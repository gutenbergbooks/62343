<small>DOWN CHANNEL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had left Gravesend at four o&#8217;clock in the
morning, and now, at half-past eight o&#8217;clock in
the evening, we were off the South Foreland,
the ship on a taut bowline heading on a due
down Channel course.</p>

<p>It was a September night, with an edge of
winter in the gusts and blasts which swept
squall-like into the airy darkling hollows of
the canvas. There was a full moon, small as
a silver cannon-ball, with a tropical greenish
tinge in its icy sparkling, and the scud came
sweeping up over it in shreds and curls and
feathers of vapour, sailing up dark from where
the land of France was, and whitening out into
a gossamer delicacy of tint as it soared into
and fled through the central silver splendour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
The weight of the whole range of Channel was
in the run of the surge that flashed into
masses of white water from the ponderous
bow of the Indiaman as she stormed and
crushed her way along, the tacks of her
courses groaning to every windward roll, as
though the clew of each sail were the hand of
a giant seeking to uproot the massive iron
bolt that confined the corner of the groaning
cloths to the deck.</p>

<p>The towering foreland showed in a pale
and windy heap on the starboard quarter.
The land ran in a sort of elusive faintness
along our beam, with the Dover lights hanging
in the pallid shadow like a galaxy of
fireflies: beyond them a sort of trembling
nebulous sheen, marking Folkestone; and on
high in the clear dusk over the quarter you
saw the Foreland light like some wild and
yellow star staring down upon the sea clear
of the flight of the wing-like scud.</p>

<p>The ship was the <i>Countess Ida</i>, a well-known
Indiaman of her day&mdash;now so long
ago that it makes me feel as though I were
two centuries old to be able to relate that I
was a hearty young fellow in those times.
She was bound to Bombay. Most of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
passengers had come aboard at Gravesend, I
amongst them; and here we were now thrashing
our way into the widening waters of the
Channel, mighty thankful&mdash;those of us who
were not sea-sick, I mean&mdash;that there had
come a shift of wind when the southern limb
of the Goodwin Sands was still abreast, to
enable us to keep our anchors at the cathead
and save us a heart-wearying spell of detention
in the Downs.</p>

<p>The vessel looked noble by moonlight;
she was showing a maintopgallant sail to the
freshening wind, and the canvas soared to
high aloft in shadowy spaces, which came and
went in a kind of winking as the luminary
leapt from the edge of the hurrying clouds
into some little lagoon of soft indigo, flashing
down a very rain of silver fires, till the long
sparkling beam travelling over the foaming
heads of the seas, like a spoke of a revolving
wheel, was extinguished in a breath by the
sweep of a body of vapour over the lovely
planet. I stood at the rail that ran athwart
the break of the poop, surveying this grand
night-picture of the outward-bound Indiaman.
From time to time there would be a roaring
of water off her weather-bow, that glanced in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the moonshine in a huge fountain of prismatic
crystals. The figures of a couple
of seamen keeping a look-out trudged the
weather-side of the forecastle, their shadows
at their feet starting out upon the white plank
to some quick and brilliant hurl of moonlight,
clear as a sketch in ink, upon white paper.
Amidships, forward, loomed up the big
galley, with a huge long-boat stowed before
it roofed with spare booms; on either hand
rose the high bulwarks with three carronades
of a side stealing out of the dusk between the
tall defences of the ship like the shapes of
beasts crouching to obtain a view of the sea
through the port-holes. A red ray of light
came aslant from the galley and touched with
its rusty radiance a few links of the huge
chain cable that was ranged along the decks,
a coil of rope hanging upon a belaying pin,
and a fragment of bulwarks stanchion. Now
and again a seaman would pass through this
light, the figure of him coming out red against
the greenish silver in the atmosphere. A
knot of passengers hung together close under
the weather poop ladder, with a broad white
space of the quarter-deck sloping from their
feet to the lee waterways, whence at intervals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
there would come a sound of choking and
gasping as the heave of the ship brought the
dark Channel surge brimming to the scupper
holes. The growling hum of the voices of the
men blended in a strange effect upon the ear
with the shrill singing of the wind in the
rigging and the ceaseless washing noises over
the side and the long-drawn creaking sounds
which arise from all parts of a ship struggling
against a head sea under a press of
canvas.</p>

<p>Aft on the poop where I was standing the
vessel had something of a deserted look. The
pilot had been dropped off Deal; the officer
of the watch (the chief mate) was stumping
the weather-side of the deck from the ladder
to abreast of the foremost skylight; the dark
figure of the captain swung in a sort of pendulum-tramping
from the mizzen rigging to
the grating abaft the wheel. Dim as a distant
firebrand over the port quarter, windily
flickering upon the stretch of throbbing
waters, shone the lantern of the lightship off
the South Sand Head; and it was odd to
mark how it rose and fell upon the speeding
night sky to the swift yet stately pitching of
our ship, with the figure of the man at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
helm somehow showing the vaguer for it,
spite of the shining of the binnacle lamp flinging
a little golden haze round about the compass
stand, abaft which the shape of the fellow
showed vague as the outline of a ghost.</p>

<p>Ha! thought I, <i>this</i> is being at sea now
indeed! Why, though we were in narrow
waters yet, there was such a note of ocean
yearning in the thunderous wash of the
weather billows sweeping along the bends
that, but for the pale glimmer of the
line of land trending away to starboard, I
might easily have imagined the whole waters
of the great Atlantic to be under our bow.</p>

<p>It was a bit chilly, and I caught myself
hugging my peacoat to me with a half-formed
resolution to make for my cabin, where there
were yet some traps of mine remaining to be
stowed away. But I lingered&mdash;lover of all
sea-effects, as I then was and still am&mdash;to
watch a fine brig blowing past us along to the
Downs, the strong wind gushing fair over her
quarter, and her canvas rising in marble-like
curves to the tiny royals; every cloth glancing
in pearl to the dance of the moon amongst
the clouds, every rope upon her glistening
out into silver wire, with the foam, white as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
sifted snow, lifting to her hawse-pipes to the
clipper shearing of her keen stem, and not a
light aboard of her but what was kindled by
the luminary in the glass and brass about her
decks as she went rolling past us delicate as a
vision, pale as steam, yet of an exquisite
grace as determinable as a piece of painting
on ivory.</p>

<p>I walked aft to the companion hatch and
entered the cuddy, or, as it is now called, the
saloon. The apartment was the width of the
ship, and was indeed a very splendid and
spacious state-cabin, with a bulkhead at the
extremity under the wheel, where the captain&#8217;s
bedroom was, and a berth alongside
of it, where the skipper worked out his
navigation along with the officers, and where
the midshipmen went to school. There were
also two berths right forward close against
the entrance to the cuddy by way of the
quarter-deck, occupied by the first and second
mates; otherwise, the interior was as clear as
a ballroom, and it was like entering a
brilliantly illuminated pavilion ashore, to pass
out of the windy dusk of the night and the
flying moonshine of it into the soft brightness
of oil-flames burning in handsome lamps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
white and gleaming metal, duplicated by
mirrors, with hand-paintings between and
polished panels in which the radiance cloudily
rippled. A long table went down the centre
of this cuddy, and over it were the domes
of the skylights, in which were many plants
and flowers of beauty swinging in pots, and
globes of fish and silver swinging trays.
Right through the heart of the interior came
the shaft of the mizzen mast, rich with
chiselled configurations, and of a delicate
hue; a handsome piano stood lashed to the
deck abaft the trunk of giant spar. The
planks were finely carpeted, and sofas and
arm-chairs ran the length of this glittering
saloon on either side of it.</p>

<p>There were a few people assembled at the
fore-end of the table as I made my way to
the hatch whose wide steps led to the sleeping
berths below. It was not hard to perceive
that one of them was an East Indian
military gentleman whose liver was on fire
through years of curry. His white whiskers
of the wire-like inflexibility of a cat&#8217;s, stood
out on either side his lemon-coloured cheeks;
his little blood-shot eyes of indigo sparkled
under overhanging brows where the hair lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
thick like rolls of cotton-wool. This gentleman
I knew to be Colonel Bannister, and as
I cautiously made my way along&mdash;for the
movements of the decks were staggering
enough to oblige me to tread warily&mdash;I
gathered that he was ridiculing the medical
profession to Dr. Hemmeridge, the ship&#8217;s
surgeon, for its inability to prescribe for
sea-sickness.</p>

<p>&#8216;It iss der nerves,&#8217; I heard a fat Dutch
gentleman say&mdash;afterwards known to me as
Peter Hemskirk, manager of a firm in
Bombay.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nerves!&#8217; sneered the colonel, with a
glance at the Dutchman&#8217;s waistcoat. &#8216;Don&#8217;t
you know the difference between the nerves
and the stomach, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Same thing,&#8217; exclaimed Dr. Hemmeridge
soothingly; &#8216;sea-sickness means the head,
any way; and pray, colonel, what are the
brains but&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha! ha!&#8217; roared the colonel, interrupting
him; &#8216;<i>there</i> I have you. If it be the
brains only which are affected, why, then,
ha! ha! no wonder Mynheer here doesn&#8217;t
suffer, though it&#8217;s his first voyage, he says.&#8217;</p>

<p>But my descent of the steps carried me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
out of earshot of this interesting talk. My
cabin was well aft. There was a fairly wide
corridor, and the berths were ranged on either
hand of it. From some of them, as I made
my way along, came in muffled sounds various
notes of lamentation and suffering. A black
woman, with a ring through her nose and her
head draped in white, sat on the deck in front
of the closed door of a berth, moaning in a
sea-sick way over a baby that she rocked in
her arms, and that was crying at the top of
its pipes. The door of a cabin immediately
opposite opened, and a young fellow with a
ghastly face putting his head out exclaimed
in accents strongly suggestive of nausea:
&#8216;I thay, confound it! thtop that noithe, will
you? The rolling ith bad enough without
<i>that</i> thindy. Thteward!&#8217; The ship gave a
lurch, and he swung out, but instantly darted
back again, being indeed but half clothed: &#8216;I
thay, are <i>you</i> the thteward?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Keep on singing out.
Somebody&#8217;ll come to you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Won&#8217;t they thmother that woman?&#8217; he
shouted, and he would have said more, but a
sudden kickup of the ship slammed his cabin
door for him, and the next moment my ear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
caught a sound that indicated too surely his
rashness in leaving his bunk.</p>

<p>I entered my berth, and found the lamp
alight in it, and the young gentleman who
was to share the cabin with me sitting in his
bedstead, that was above mine, dangling his
legs over the edge of it, and gazing with a
disordered countenance upon the deck. I had
chatted with him during the afternoon and
had learnt who he was. Indeed, his name
was in big letters upon his portmanteau&mdash;&#8216;The
Hon. Stephen Colledge;&#8217; and incidentally
he had told me that he was a son of Lord
Sandown, and that he was bound to India on
a shooting tour. He was a good-looking
young man, with fair whiskers, white teeth, a
genial smile, yet with something of affectation
in his way of speaking.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s doocid rough, isn&#8217;t it, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;
said he; &#8216;and isn&#8217;t it raining?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, but look at the glass here,&#8217; he exclaimed,
indicating the scuttle or porthole,
the thick glass of which showed gleaming,
but black as coal against the night outside.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said I, &#8216;the wet there is the sea;
it is spray; nothing but spray.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8216;Hang all waves!&#8217; he said in a low voice.
&#8216;Why the dickens can&#8217;t the ocean always be
calm? If I&#8217;d have known that this ship
pitched so, I&#8217;d have waited for a steadier
vessel. Will you do me the kindness to lift
the lid of that portmanteau? You&#8217;ll find a
flask of brandy in it. Hang me if I like to
move. Sorry now I didn&#8217;t bring a cot, though
they&#8217;re doocid awkward things to get in and
out of.&#8217;</p>

<p>I found the flask, and gave it to him, and
he took a pull at it. I declined his offer of a
dram, and went to work to stow away some
odds and ends which were in my trunk.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you feel ill?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, ah, I remember now!&#8217; he exclaimed;
&#8216;you were a sailor once, weren&#8217;t you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; I had a couple of years of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Wish <i>I&#8217;d</i> been a sailor, I know,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;I mean, after I&#8217;d given it up. As to <i>being</i> a
sailor&mdash;merciful goodness! think of four, perhaps
five months of <i>this</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, you&#8217;ll be as good a sailor as ever a
seaman amongst us in a day or two,&#8217; said I
encouragingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t feel like it now, though,&#8217; he exclaimed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
&#8216;Let&#8217;s see: I think you said you
were going out to do some painting?&mdash;Oh no!
I beg pardon: it was a chap named Emmett
who told me that. You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; He looked
at me with a slightly inebriated cock of the
head, from which I might infer that the &#8216;pull&#8217;
he had taken at his flask was by no means his
first &#8216;drain&#8217; within the hour.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I, with a laugh; &#8216;I am going
out to see an old relative up country. And
not more for that than for the fun of a
voyage.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The <i>fun</i> of the voyage!&#8217; he echoed with
a stupid face; then with a sudden brightening
up of his manner, though his gloomy countenance
quickly returned to him, he exclaimed,
&#8216;I say, Dugdale&mdash;beg pardon, you know; no
good in <i>mistering</i> a chap that you&#8217;re going to
sleep with for four or five months&mdash;call me
Colledge, old fellow&mdash;but I say, though, seen
anything more of that ripping girl since
dinner? By George! what eyes, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>He drew his legs up, and with a slight
groan composed himself in a posture for sleep,
manifestly heedless of any answer I might
make to his question.</p>

<p>I lingered awhile in the berth, and then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
filling a pipe, mounted to the saloon, and
made my way to the quarter-deck to smoke
in the shelter of the recess in the cuddy
front. Colonel Bannister lay sprawling upon
a sofa, holding a tumbler of brandy grog.
There were other passengers in the cuddy,
scattered, and all of them grimly silent, staring
hard at the lamps, yet with something of
vacancy in their regard, as though their
thoughts were elsewhere. As I stepped on to
the quarter-deck, the cries and chorusing of
men aloft, came sounding through the strong
and hissing pouring of the wind between the
masts and through the harsh seething of the
seas, which the bows of the ship were smiting
into snowstorms as she went sullenly ploughing
through the water with the weather-leech of
the maintopgallant-sail trembling in the green
glancings of the moonlight like the fly of a
flag in a breeze of wind. They were taking a
reef in the fore and mizzen topsails. The chief
mate, Mr. Prance, from time to time, would
sing out an order over my head that was
answered by a hoarse &#8216;Ay, ay, sir,&#8217; echoing
out of the gloom in which the fore-part of the
ship was plunged. I lighted my pipe and sat
myself down on the coamings of the booby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
hatch to enjoy a smoke. I was alone, and
this moon-touched flying Channel night-scene
carried my memory back to the times when I
was a sailor, when I had paced the deck of
such another vessel as this, as a midshipman
of her. It seemed a long time ago, yet it was
no more than six years either. The old professional
instinct was quickened in me by the
voices of the fellows aloft, till I felt as though
it were my watch on deck, that I was skulking
under the break of the poop here, and
that I ought to be aloft jockeying a lee yard-arm
or dangling to windward on the flemish
horse.</p>

<p>Presently all was quiet on high, and by
the windy sheen in the atmosphere, caused by
the commingling of white waters and the frequent
glance of the moon through some rent
in the ragged scud, I could make out the
figures of the fellows on the fore descending
the shrouds. A little while afterwards a deep
sea voice broke out into a strange wild song,
that was caught up and re-echoed in a hurricane
chorus by the tail of men hauling upon
the halliards to masthead the yard. It was
a proper sort of note to fit such a night as
that. A minute after, a chorus of a like gruffness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
but of a different melody resounded on
the poop, where they were mastheading the
topsail yard after reefing it. The combined
notes flung a true oceanic character into the
picture of the darkling Indiaman swelling and
rolling and pitching in floating launches
through it, with her wide pinions rising in
spaces of faintness to the scud, and the black
lines of her royal yards sheering to and fro
against the moon that, when she showed,
seemed to reel amidst the rushing wings of
vapour to the wild dance of our mastheads.
The songs of the sailors, the clear shrill whistling
of a boatswain&#8217;s mate forward, the orders
uttered quickly by the chief officer, the washing
noises of the creaming surges, the sullen shouting
of the wind in the rigging resembling the
sulky breaker-like roar of a wood of tall trees
swept by a gale&mdash;all this made one feel that one
was at sea in earnest.</p>

<p>I knocked the ashes out of my pipe and
went on to the poop. The land still showed
very dimly to starboard, with here and there
little oozings of dim radiance that might mark
a village or a town. You could see to the
horizon, where the water showed in a sort of
greenish blackness with some speck of flame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of a French lighthouse over the port quarter,
and the September clouds soaring up off the
edge of the sea like puffs and coils of smoke
from a thousand factory chimneys down there,
and now and again a bright star glancing out
from amongst them as they came swiftly floating
up to the moon, turning of a silvery white
as they neared the glorious planet.</p>

<p>There were windows in the cuddy front,
and as I glanced through one of them I saw the
captain come down the companion steps into
the brightly lighted saloon and seat himself
at the table, where in a moment he was joined
by the fiery-eyed little colonel. Decanters
and glasses were placed by one of the stewards
on a swing-tray, and the scene then had something
of a homely look spite of the cuddy&#8217;s
aspect of comparative desertion. Captain
Keeling, I think, was about the most sailorly-looking
man I ever remember meeting. I had
heard of him ashore, and learnt that he had
used the sea for upwards of forty-five years.
He had served in every kind of craft, and had
obtained great reputation amongst owners and
underwriters for his defence and preservation
of an Indiaman he was in command of that
was attacked in the Bay of Bengal by a heavily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
armed French picaroon full of men. Cups
and swords and services of plate and purses
of money were heaped upon him for his conduct
in that affair; and indeed in his way he
was a sort of small Commodore Dance.</p>

<p>I looked at him with some interest as he
sat beside the colonel with the full light of
the lamp over against him shining upon his
face and figure. There had been little enough
to see of him during the day, and it was not
until we dropped the pilot that he showed
himself. His countenance was crimsoned with
long spells of tropic weather, and hardened
into ruggedness like the face of a rock by the
years of gales he had gone through. He was
about sixty years of age; and his short-cropped
hair was as white as silver, with a thin line of
whisker of a like fleecy sort slanting from his
ear to the middle of his cheek. His nose was
shaped like the bowl of a clay-pipe, and was
of a darker red than the rest of his face. His
small sea-blue eyes were sunk deep, as though
from the effect of long staring to windward;
and almost hidden as they were by the heavy
ridge of silver eyebrow, they seemed to be no
more than gimlet holes in his head for the admission
of light. He had thrown open his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
peacoat, and discovered a sort of uniform
under it: a buff-coloured waistcoat with gilt
buttons, an open frock-coat of blue cloth with
velvet lapels. Around his neck was a satin
stock, in which were three pins, connected by
small chains. His shirt collar was divided
behind, and rose in two sharp points under
his chin, which obliged him to keep his head
erect in a quite military posture. Such was
Captain Keeling, commander of the famous old
Indiaman <i>Countess Ida</i>.</p>

<p>I guessed he would not remain long below,
otherwise I should have been tempted to join
him in a glass of grog, spite of the company
of Colonel Bannister, who was hardly the sort
of man to make one feel happy on such an
occasion as the first night out at sea with
memory bitterly recent of leave-taking, of
kisses, of the hand-shakes of folks one might
never see again.</p>

<small>THE FRENCH LUGGER</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> pipe was out; the quarter-deck bulwarks
hid the sea, and so I mounted the poop ladder
to take a look round before turning in. Away
to port, or <i>larboard</i>, as we then called it, was
a full-rigged ship rolling up Channel under
all plain sail, with such a smother of white
yeast clouding her bows, and racing aft into
the long line of her wake, which went glaring
over the dark throbbing waters, that it made
one think of the base of a waterspout writhing
upwards to meet the descending tube of
vapour. She was the first object that took
my eye, and I hurriedly crossed the deck to
view her. Mr. Prance, the chief mate, stood
at the rail watching her.</p>

<p>&#8216;A noble sight!&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir, an English frigate. A fifty-one
gun vessel, apparently. Upon my word,
nothing statelier ever swam, or ever again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
will swim, than ships of that kind. Look at
the line of her batteries&mdash;black and white
like the keys of a pianoforte! What squareness
of yard, sir! Her main-royal should be
as big as our topgallant-sail.&#8217;</p>

<p>He sent a look aloft at the reeling, fabric
over our heads, with a thoughtful drag, at a
short growth of beard that curled upwards
from his chin like the fore-thatch of a sou&#8217;-wester.
The noble ship went floating out
into the darkness astern, and her pale heights
died upon the gloom like a burst of steam
dissolving in the wind.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is that out yonder upon the starboard
bow there, Mr. Prance?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He peered awhile, and said: &#8216;Some craft
reaching like ourselves&mdash;standing as we head&mdash;a
lumpish thing, anyhow. What a blot
she makes, seeing that she has no height of
spar!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We are overhauling her,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; he answered, keeping his eyes fixed
upon her. &#8216;Doesn&#8217;t she seem a bit uncertain,
though?&#8217; he muttered, as if thinking aloud.</p>

<p>I had wonderfully good sight in those
days, and after straining my eyes awhile
against the heap of scarce determinable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
shadow which the craft made, I exclaimed:
&#8216;She&#8217;ll be a French lugger, or I&#8217;m greatly
mistaken.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe you are right, sir,&#8217; answered the
mate.</p>

<p>He drew a little away from me, as a hint,
perhaps, that he desired to address his attention
to the vessel on the bow, and suddenly
putting his hand to his mouth, he hailed the
forecastle in a sharp clear note. An answer
was returned swift as the tone of a bell to the
blow of its tongue.</p>

<p>&#8216;Show a light forward! Smartly now!
That chap ahead seems asleep.&#8217;</p>

<p>There were no side-lights in those days.
Some long years were to elapse before the
Shipping Act enforced the use of a night
signal more to the point than a short flourish
of the binnacle lamp over the side. In a few
moments a large globular lantern in the grip
of a seaman, whose figure showed like a
sketch in phosphorus to the illumination of
the flame, was rested upon the forecastle rail,
with the night beyond him looking the
blacker for the rising and falling point of
fire. The hint seemed to be taken by the
fellow ahead, and the mate walked aft to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
binnacle, into which he stood looking, afterwards
going to the rail, at which he lingered,
staring forwards.</p>

<p>I crossed over to leeward to watch the
milk-like race of waters along the side. The
foam made a sort of twilight of its own in
the air. Under the foot of the mainsail that
was arched transversely across the deck, the
wind stormed with a note of hurricane out
of the huge concavity of the cloths, and
made the rushing snow giddy with the
whipping of it, till the eye reeled again to
the sight of the yeasty boiling. Never did
any ship raise such a smother about her as
the <i>Countess Ida</i>. Our speed was scarce a
full five miles, and yet, looking over to
leeward, when the huge fabric came heeling
down to her channels to the scud of a sea and
to the weight of the wind in her canvas, you
would have supposed her thundering through
it a whole ten knots at least.</p>

<p>On a sudden there was a loud and fearful
cry forward. &#8216;Port your hellum! port your
hellum!&#8217; I could hear a voice roaring out
with a meaning as of life or death in the
startling vehemence of the utterance.</p>

<p>&#8216;Starboard! starboard!&#8217; shouted Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Prance, who was still standing aft: &#8216;over
with it, men, for God&#8217;s sake, before we&#8217;re
into her!&#8217;</p>

<p>Next instant there was a dull shock
throughout the ship; a thrill that ran
through her planks into the very soles of
one&#8217;s feet, while there arose shrieks and
shouts as from three-score throats under the
bows, and a most lamentable and terrifying
noise of wood-splintering, of canvas tearing,
of liberated sails flogging the wind. I
bounded to the weather-rail, and saw a large
hull of some eighty tons wholly dismasted&mdash;a
wild scene of wreck and ruin to the flash
of the moon at that moment shining down
out of a clear space of sky&mdash;gliding past into
our wake. The dark object seemed filled
with men, and the yells left me in no doubt
that she was a Frenchman&mdash;a large three-masted
lugger, as I had supposed her.</p>

<p>In an instant our ship was in an uproar.
There is nothing in language to express the
noise and excitement. To begin with, our
helm having been put down, we had come
round into the wind, and lay pitching heavily
with sails slatting and thundering, yards
creaking, rigging straining. The sailors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
rushed to and fro. All discipline for the
moment seemed to have gone overboard.
The captain had come tumbling up on deck,
and was calling orders to the mate, who
re-echoed them in loud bawlings to the
quarter-deck and forecastle. Lanterns were
got up and shown over the rail, and by the
light of them you saw the figures of the
seamen speeding from rope to rope and
hauling upon the gear, their gruff, harsh
chorusings rising high above the terrified
chatter of the passengers&mdash;many of whom
had rushed up on deck barely clothed&mdash;high
also above the storming and shrilling of the
wind, the deep notes of angry waters warring
at our bows, and the distracting shaking and
beating of the sails.</p>

<p>But a few orders delivered by Mr. Prance,
whose tongue was as a trumpet in a moment
like this, acted upon the ship as the sympathetic
hand of a horseman upon a restive
terrified thoroughbred.</p>

<p>&#8216;Haul up the mainsail&mdash;fore clew garnets&mdash;back
maintopsail yard&mdash;tail on to the
weather-braces and round in handsomely.
Mr. Cocker (this was addressed to the second-mate,
who had tumbled up with the rest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the watch below on feeling the thump the
<i>Countess Ida</i> had given herself, and on hearing
the uproar that followed)&mdash;burn a flare&mdash;smartly,
if you please! Also get blue lights
and rockets up.&#8217;</p>

<p>I ran aft to see if the vessel that we had
wrecked was anywhere about. The moon
was shining brilliantly down upon the sea at
that time, and the swollen Channel waters
were lifting their black heights into creaming
peaks in an atmosphere of delicate silver haze,
that yet suffered the eye to penetrate to the
dark confines of the horizon. The wake of
the planet was a long throbbing line of angry
broken splendour in the south; but the tail
of it seemed to stream fair to the point of sea
into which the lugger had veered, and I was
confident that if she were afloat I should see
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who is that to leeward there?&#8217; called
the captain from the other side of the wheel
in a tone of worry and irritation.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, beg pardon, I&#8217;m sure,&#8217; he exclaimed;
&#8216;do you see anything of the vessel that we&#8217;ve
run down?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing,&#8217; I responded.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>&#8216;She must have foundered,&#8217; said he; &#8216;yet
though I listened, I heard no cries after
the wreck had once fairly settled away from
us.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here the mate came aft hastily, and with
a touch of his cap, reported that the well had
been sounded, and that all was right with the
ship.</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well, sir,&#8217; said the captain. &#8216;I shall
keep all fast with my boats. The calamity
can&#8217;t be helped. I&#8217;m not going to increase it
by sacrificing my men&#8217;s lives. The poor
devils will have had a boat of their own, I
suppose. Show blue lights, will ye, Mr.
Prance, and send a rocket up from time to
time.&#8217;</p>

<p>They were burning a flare over the
quarter-deck rail at that moment&mdash;some
turpentine arrangement, that threw out a long
flickering flame and a great coil of smoke
from the yawning mouth of the tin funnel
that contained the mixture. It was like
watching the ship by sheet-lightning to see a
large part of her amidships and her mainmast
and the pale lights of the mainsail hanging
from the yard in the grip of the gear&mdash;to see
all this come and go as the flame leapt and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
faded. There was a crowd of terrified
passengers on the poop, some of them ladies,
hugging themselves in dressing-gowns and
shawls; and out of the heart of the little mob
rose the saw-like notes of Colonel Bannister.</p>

<p>&#8216;These collisions,&#8217; I heard him cry, &#8216;never
<i>can</i> take place if a proper look-out be kept.
It is preposterous to argue. I&#8217;d compel the
oldest seaman who contradicted me to eat his
words. Why, have I been making the voyage
to India four times&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; But the rest of his
observations were drowned in cries of astonishment
and alarm from the ladies as a rocket,
discharged close to them, went hissing and
shearing up athwart the howling wind in a
stream of fire, breaking on high into a blood-red
ball, that floated swiftly landwards, like
an electric meteor, ghastly against the moonshine,
with a wide crimson atmosphere about
it that tinctured the very scud. A moment
after a blue light was burnt over the side
from the head of the poop ladder, whereat
there was a general recoil and more shrill
exclamations from the ladies. In fact, these
wild mystical lights as it were coming on
top of the fancy of men drowning astern, and
colouring the ship with unearthly glares, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
flinging a wonderful complexion of horror
upon the night for a wide space round about
the pitching and groaning Indiaman, put such
an element of mystery and fear into the scene
that though I was by no means a new hand at
such sea-shows, I will own to shuddering
again and yet again as I overhung the side
of the poop, striving to discern any object
that might resemble a boat in the foam-whitened
gloom into which the lugger had
slided.</p>

<p>&#8216;What has happened? Everybody is so
excited that one can&#8217;t get at the real story.&#8217;</p>

<p>I turned quickly, and saw the tall figure
of a lady at my side. She was habited in a
cloak, the hood of which was over her head,
and darkened her face almost to the concealment
of it, saving her eyes, which shone large,
liquid, with a clear red spot in the depths,
from the reflection of the flare at the quarter-deck
bulwark.</p>

<p>I briefly explained, lifting my cap as I gave
her her name&mdash;Miss Temple&mdash;for I had particularly
remarked her as she came aboard at
Gravesend, and asked who she was, though I
had seen nothing more of her down to that
moment. I ended my account pointing to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
quarter of the sea where the lugger had disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thanks for the story,&#8217; she exclaimed,
with a sudden note of haughtiness in her
voice, while she kept her eyes, of the rich
blackness of the tropic night-sky, fixed firm and
gleaming upon me, as though she had addressed
me in error, and wanted to make sure of me.
She moved as though she would walk off,
paused, and said: &#8216;Poor creatures! I hope
they will be saved. Is our ship injured, do
you know?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe not,&#8217; said I a little coldly.
&#8216;There may be a rope or two broken forward
perhaps, but there is nothing but the French
lugger to be sorry for.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My aunt, Mrs. Radcliffe,&#8217; said she, &#8216;has
been rendered somewhat hysterical by the
commotion on deck. She is too ill to
leave her bed. I think I may reassure
her?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes,&#8217; I exclaimed. &#8216;But yonder,
abreast of the wheel there, is the captain to
confirm my words.&#8217;</p>

<p>She gave me a bow, or rather a curtsey
of those days, and walked aft to address
the captain, as I supposed. Instead, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
descended the companion hatch, and I lost
sight of her.</p>

<p>A disdainful lady, thought I, but a rare
beauty too!&mdash;marvellous eyes, anyhow, to behold
by such an illumination as this of rockets
and blue lights, and flying moonshine, and the
yellow glimmer of flare-tins.</p>

<p>All this while the ship lay hove-to, her
maintopsail to the mast, the folds of her
hanging mainsail sending a low thunder into
the wind as it shook its cloths, the seas
breaking in stormy noises from her bow; but
<i>now</i> there fell a dead silence upon the people
along her decks: nothing broke this hush
upon the life of the vessel, save the occasional
harsh hissing rush of a rocket piercing the
restless noises of the sea and the whistling of
the wind in the rigging. The bulwark rail
was lined with sailors, eagerly looking towards
the tail of the misty wake of the moon, into
which the black surges went shouldering and
changing into troubled hills of dull silver.
The captain and two of the mates stood aft,
intently watching the water, often putting
themselves into strained hearkening postures,
their hands to their ears. Most of the lady
passengers went below, but not to bed, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
you could catch a sight of them through the
skylight seated at the table talking swiftly,
often directing anxious glances at the window-glass
through which you could see them.
There was one majestic old lady amongst them
with grey hair that looked to be powdered, a
hawk&#8217;s-bill nose, an immense bosom, that
started immediately from under her chin.
The lamplight flashed in diamonds in her ears,
and in rubies and in stones of value and
beauty upon her fingers. She was Colonel
Bannister&#8217;s wife, and was apparently not
wanting in her husband&#8217;s fiery energy and
capacity of taking peppery views of things, if
I might judge by her vehement nods, and the
glances she shot around her from her grey
eyes. It was a cabin picture I caught but a
glimpse of as I crossed the deck to take a look
to leeward, but one, somehow, that sunk into
my memory, maybe because of the magic-lantern-like
look of the interior, with its
brilliant lamps and many-coloured attire of the
ladies in their shawls, dressing-gowns, and what
not&mdash;standing out upon the eye amidst the wild
dark frame of the seething clamorous night.</p>

<p>All at once there was a loud cry. I
rushed back to the weather rail.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>&#8216;There&#8217;s a boat heading for us, sir&mdash;see
her, sir? Away yonder, this side o&#8217; the
tumble of the moon&#8217;s reflection!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, there she is! It&#8217;ll be the lugger&#8217;s
boat. God, how she dives!&#8217;</p>

<p>Twenty shadowy arms pointed in the
direction which had been indicated by the
gruff grumbling cries of the sailors. The
second mate, Mr. Cocker, came hastily forward
to the break of the poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;Stand by, some of you,&#8217; he shouted, &#8216;to
heave them the end of a line. Make ready
with bowlines to help them over the side.&#8217;</p>

<p>I could see the boat clearly now as she
rose to the height of a sea, her black wet side
sparkling out an instant to the moonlight ere
she sank out of sight past the ivory white
head of the surge sweeping under her. She
seemed to be deep with men; but I could
count only two oars. She was rushed down
upon us by the impulse of the sea and wind,
and I felt my heart stand still as she drove
bow on into us, whirling round alongside in a
manner to make you look for the wreck of
her in staves washing away under our counter.
She was full of people, with women amongst
them&mdash;poor creatures, in great white caps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and long golden earrings, the men for the
most part in huge fishermen&#8217;s boots, and
tasselled caps and jerseys that might have
been of any colour in that light. One could
just make these features out, but no more, for
the contents of the boat as it rose soaring and
falling alongside were but a dark huddle of
human shapes, writhing and twisting like a
mass of worms in a pot, vociferating to us in
the scarce intelligible <i>patois</i> of Gravelines or
Calais or Boulogne.</p>

<p>There was no magic in the commands even
of British officers to British sailors to put the
least element of calm into the business. It
was not only that at one moment the boat
alongside seemed to be hove up to the Indiaman&#8217;s
covering-board and that at the next she
was rushing down into a chasm that laid bare
many feet of the big ship&#8217;s yellow sheathing:
there was the dreadful expectation of the
whole of the human freight being overset and
drowning alongside in a breath; there were
the heart-rending shouts of the distracted
people; there was the total inability of captain
and mates to make themselves understood.
How it was managed I will not pretend to explain.
By some means the boat was dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
to the gangway, grinding and thumping herself
horribly against the Indiaman&#8217;s rolling, stooping,
massive side; then bowlines and ropes in
plenty were dangled over or flung into her;
and through the unshipped gangway, illuminated
by half-a-dozen lanterns, and crowded
by a hustling mob of sailors and passengers,
one after another, the women and the men&mdash;most
of the men coming first!&mdash;were dragged
inboards, some of them falling flat upon the
deck, some dropping on their knees and crossing
themselves; a few of the women weeping
passionately, one of them sobbing in dreadful
paroxysms, the others mute as statues, as
though terror and the presence of death had
frozen the lifeblood in them and arrested the
very beating of their hearts. Two of them
fell into the sea; but they had lines about
them and were dragged up half dead. They
were all of them dripping wet, the men&#8217;s sea-boots
full of water; whilst the soaked gowns
of the women flooded the deck on which they
stood, as though several buckets of brine had
been capsized there.</p>

<p>Old Keeling&#8217;s pity for them would not go
to the length of introducing the wretched
creatures into the cuddy, to spoil the ship&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
fine carpets and stain and ruin the coverings
of the couches. They were accordingly
brought together in the recess under the
break of the poop, where at all events they
were sheltered. Hot spirits and water were
given to them along with bread and meat, and
this supper the unhappy creatures ate by the
light of the dimly burning lanterns held by
the sailors.</p>

<p>There never was an odder wilder sight
than the picture the poor half-drowned
creatures made. Some of the women scarcely
once intermitted their sobs and lamentations,
save when they silenced their throats by a
mouthful of food or drink. They were very
ugly, dark as coffee; and their black wet hair
streaming like sea-weed upon their shoulders
and brows from under their soaked caps
made them look like witches. The men
talked hoarsely and eagerly with many
passionate gestures, which suggested fierce
denunciation. The mate coming down to the
booby hatch around which these people were
squatting, eating, drinking, moaning, and
jabbering without the least regard to the
crowd of curious eyes which inspected them
from the quarter-deck&mdash;the mate, I say, coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
down, stood looking a minute at them, and
then sent a glance round, and seeing me, asked
if I spoke French.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I, &#8216;but not such French as those
people are talking.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We have three passengers,&#8217; said he, &#8216;who,
I am told, are scholars in that language; but
the steward informs me they&#8217;re too sea-sick to
come on deck. Just ask these people in such
French as you have, if their captain&#8217;s amongst
them.&#8217;</p>

<p>As he said this, a little old man seated on
the hatch-coaming, with a red nightcap on,
immense earrings, and a face of leather puckered
into a thousand wrinkles like the grin of
a monkey, looked up at Mr. Prance, and
nodding with frightful energy whilst he struck
his bosom with his clenched fist, cried out:
&#8216;Yash, yash, me capitaine.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; said the mate, &#8216;do you speak English,
then?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yash, yash,&#8217; he roared: &#8216;me speakee Angleesh.&#8217;</p>

<p>Happily he knew enough to save me the
labour of interpreting; and <i>labour</i> it would have
been with a vengeance, since, though it was
perfectly certain none amongst them, saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
the little monkey-faced man, comprehended a
syllable of the mate&#8217;s questions, every time
the small withered chap answered&mdash;which he
did with extraordinary convulsions and a vast
variety of frantic gesticulations&mdash;all the rest
of them broke into speech, the women joining
in, and there was such a hubbub of tongues
that not an inch of idea could I have got out
of the distracting row. However, in course
of time the leathery manikin who called himself
captain made Mr. Prance understand that
the lugger belonged to Boulogne; that she
had the survivors of another lugger on board,
making some thirty-four souls in all, men and
women, at the time of the collision, of which
seventeen or eighteen were drowned. After
he had given Mr. Prance these figures, he
turned to the others and said something in a
shrill, fierce, rapid voice, whereat the women
fell to shrieking and weeping, whilst many of
the men tore their hair, some going the length
of knocking their heads against the cuddy
front. It was a sight to sicken the heart, the
more, I think, for the unutterable element of
grotesque farce imported into that dismal
tragedy by their countenances, postures, and
behaviour; and having heard and seen enough,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
I slipped away on to the poop, with a chill
coming into my very soul to the thought of
the drowned bodies out yonder when my eye
went to the sea weltering black to the troubled
line of moonshine, and heaving in ashen luminous
billows in that chill path of light.</p>

<p>But long before this, our rockets, blue-lights,
and flares had been seen; and a moment
or two after I had gained the poop I spied the
figure of Captain Keeling with a few male
passengers at his side standing at the rail
watching a powerful cutter thrashing through
it to us close-hauled, with the water boiling
to her leaps, and her big mainsail to midway
high dark with the saturation of the flying
brine. In less than twenty minutes she was
rising and falling buoyant as a seabird abreast
of us, with a shadowy figure at her lee rail
bawling with lungs of brass to know what
was wrong.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have run down a French lugger,&#8217; shouted
Captain Keeling, &#8216;and have half her people on
board, and must put them ashore at once, for
I wish to proceed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Right y&#8217;are,&#8217; came from the cutter; but
with a note of irritation and disappointment in
the cry, as I could not but fancy.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Then followed some wonderful man&#339;uvring.
There was only one way of transshipping the
miserable French people, and that was by a
yard-arm whip and a big basket. Hands
sprang aloft to prepare the necessary tackle;
Prance meanwhile, from the head of the poop
ladder, thundered the intentions of the Indiaman
through a speaking-trumpet to the cutter.
I could see old Keeling stamp from time to
time with impatience as he broke away from
the questions of the passengers, one of whom
was Colonel Bannister, into a sharp walk full
of grief and irritability. Meanwhile they had
shifted their helm aboard the cutter and got
way upon the fine little craft. I saw her take
the weight of the wind and heel down to the
line of her gunwale, then break a dark sea
into boiling milk, leaping the liquid acclivity,
as a horse takes a tall gate, burying herself
nose under with the downwards launching rush,
then soaring again to the height of the next
billow with full way upon her. She came
tearing and hissing through it as though her
coppered forefoot were of red-hot metal, and
when abreast of our lee quarter, put her helm
down, and swept with marvellous grace and
precision to alongside of us, clear of our
shearing spars, and there she lay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>It was hard upon midnight when the last
basket-load had been lowered on to her deck.
There was no hitch; all went well; a line
attached to the basket enabled the cutter&#8217;s
people to haul it fair to their decks; but the
terror of the unfortunate Frenchmen was
painful to see. The women got into the basket
bravely; but many of the men blankly refused
to enter, and had to be stowed in it by
force, our Jacks holding on till the order to
&#8216;sway away&#8217; was given, when up would go poor
Crapaud shrieking vengeance upon us all, and
calling upon the Virgin and saints for help.
In its way it was like a little engagement with
an enemy. Some of the Frenchmen drew
knives, and had to be knocked down.</p>

<p>Then, when the last of them was swayed
over the side and lowered&mdash;&#8216;Are you all right?&#8217;
shouted Captain Keeling to the cutter.</p>

<p>&#8216;All right,&#8217; responded a deep voice, hoarse
with rum and weather. &#8216;I suppose your
owners&#8217;ll make the job worth something to
us?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay,&#8217; answered the captain. &#8216;Round
with your topsail yard, Mr. Prance. Lively
now! this business has cost us half a night as
it is.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>In a few minutes the great yards on the
main were swung slowly to the drag of the
braces with loud heave-yeos from the sailors,
and the ship, feeling the weight of the wind
in the vast dim hollow of the topsail, leaned
with a new impulse of life in her frame and
drove half an acre of foam ahead of her.
We had resumed our voyage; and with a
sense of supreme weariness in me following
the excitement of the hours, and chilled to
the marrow by my long spell on deck and
incessant loiterings in the keen night-wind, I
entered the saloon, called for a tumbler of
grog, and made my way to my berth.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br />

<small>MY FELLOW PASSENGERS</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> blew a hard breeze of wind that night.
Soon after I had left the deck they furled the
mainsail and topgallant-sail, reefed the maintopsail,
and tied another reef in the mizzen-topsail.
In fact, it looked as if we were to
have a black gale of wind, dead on end too,
with a sure prospect then of bearing up for
the Downs afresh. How it may be in these
steamboat times, I will not pretend to say;
but my experience of the old sailing-ship is
that the first night out, let the weather be
what it will, is, on the whole, about as
wretched a time as a man at any period of
his life has to pass through.</p>

<p>Mr. Colledge was sound asleep in his bunk,
his brandy flask within convenient reach of
his hand. It was certain enough that he had
heard nothing of the disturbance on deck.
I undressed and rolled into my bed, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
lay wide awake for a long time. The ship
creaked like a cradle. The full dismalness of
a first night out was upon me, and it was
made weightier yet&mdash;how much weightier
indeed!&mdash;by the recollection of the wild and
sudden tragedy of the evening. Oh, the
insufferable weariness of the noises, the straining
of the bulkheads, the yearning roar of
the dark surge washing the porthole, with the
boiling of it dying out into a dim simmering
upon the wind, the instant stagger of the ship
to the blow of some heavy sea full on her
bow, the sensation of breathless descent as
the vessel chopped down with a huge heave
to windward into the trough, the pendulum
swing of one&#8217;s wearing apparel hanging
against the bulkhead, the half-stifled exclamations
breaking from adjacent cabins, the
whole improved into a true oceanic flavour
by the occasional hoarse songs of the sailors
above, faintly heard, as though you were in a
vault, and that strange vibratory humming
which the wind makes to one hearkening to it
out of the cabin of a ship.</p>

<p>I fell asleep at last, and was awakened at
half-past seven by the steward, who wished to
know if I wanted hot water to shave with.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
The moment I had my consciousness, I was
sensible that a heavy sea was running.</p>

<p>&#8216;No shaving this morning, thank you,&#8217;
said I, &#8216;unless I have a mind to slice the
nose off my face. How&#8217;s the weather,
steward?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Blowing a buster from the south&#8217;ard,
sir,&#8217; he answered, talking with his lips at the
venetian of the closed door, &#8216;and the ship
going along &#8217;andsomely as a roll of smoke.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here somebody called him, and he trotted
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Colledge awoke. &#8216;By George!&#8217; he
exclaimed, &#8216;I&#8217;ve had a doocid long sleep.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How d&#8217;ye feel?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;In no humour to rise,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;I
suppose I can have what breakfast I&#8217;m likely
to eat brought to me here?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless you, yes,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Any news, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217; he asked, his
voice beginning to languish as a sensation of
nausea grew upon him with the larger
awakening of his faculties.</p>

<p>&#8216;We ran down a French lugger last night,&#8217;
said I, &#8216;and drowned a lot of men. That&#8217;s
all.&#8217;</p>

<p>He eyed me dully, thinking perhaps that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
I was joking, and then said: &#8216;Well, there it
is, you see. Yesterday, you were talking of
the fun of a voyage; and the very earliest of
the humours is the drowning of a lot of
men.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And women,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Poor devils!&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;Will you
hand me a bottle of Hungary water that
you&#8217;ll find in my portmanteau? Much obliged
to you, Dugdale: and will you kindly tell the
steward as you pass through the cabin to
bring me a cup of tea?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Get up by-and-by, if you feel equal to it,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;Nursing sea-sickness only makes the
demon more pitiless. Show yourself on deck,
and the wind&#8217;ll blow the nausea out of you.
And I&#8217;ll tell you a better cure than Hungary
water or brandy flasks&mdash;a cube of salt-horse,
Colledge; a hearty lump of marine beef,
something to work up the muscles of your
jaws, and to sharpen your teeth for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh gracious, my dear fellow&mdash;don&#8217;t,&#8217; he
exclaimed, turning his face to the wall of the
ship; and I heard him exclaim, as though
muttering to himself: &#8216;How the water gurgles
about this window, and what a doocid sickly
green it is!&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>But a very few of us assembled at the
breakfast table. Colonel Bannister was there,
a very ramrod of a man, with a Bengal-tigerish
expression of face as he glared round about
him from betwixt his white wire-like whiskers.
There were also present Mr. Emmett, an artist,
who was making the voyage to the East for
the purpose of painting Indian scenery, a
man with long hair curling down his back,
a ragged beard and moustaches, a velvet coat,
and Byronic collars, out of which his long
thin neck forked up like the head of a pole
through a scarecrow&#8217;s suit of clothes; Mr.
Peter Hemskirk, who looked uncommonly fat,
pale, and unfinished in his attire this morning;
two young Civil Service fellows&mdash;as we should
now call their trade&mdash;named Greenhew and
Fairthorne; and Mr. Sylvanus Johnson, a
journalist, bound to Bombay or Calcutta (I
cannot be sure of the city), to edit a newspaper&mdash;a
bullet-headed man, with a sort of
low-comedian face, very blue about the cheeks
where he shaved, and small keen restless
black eyes, full of intelligence, whose suggestion
in that way was not to be impaired or
weakened by an expression in repose of singular
self-complacency. Captain Keeling, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the head of the table, sat skewered up in his
uniform frock-coat in stiff satin stock and
collars. Mr. Prance occupied the other end
of the table. He, too, was attired in a uniform
resembling the dress worn by the skipper.
He had a pleasant brown sailorly face, with a
floating pose of head upon his shoulders that
made one think of a soap-bubble poised on
top of a pipe-stem. There were no ladies.
Once I caught a glimpse of Mrs. Colonel Bannister&#8217;s
Roman nose, and grey hair ornamented
with a large black lace cap, fitfully hovering
for a moment or two in the wide hatch past
the chief officer&#8217;s chair, down which the steps
led that went to the sleeping berths. But the
apparition vanished with almost startling
suddenness, as though the old lady had
fallen or been violently pulled below. When,
later on, I inquired after her, I learnt that
she had betaken herself again to her bunk.</p>

<p>It was a mighty uncomfortable breakfast.
The ship was rolling violently and convulsively
upon the short snappish Channel seas&mdash;the
most insufferable of all waters when in
commotion, making even the seasoned salt
pine for the long regular rhythmic heave of
the blue ocean billow. The fiddles hindered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the plates from sliding on to our laps; but
their contents were not to be so easily coaxed
into keeping their place; an unusually heavy
lurch shot a large helping of liver and bacon
on to Mr. Hemskirk&#8217;s knees; and the ship&#8217;s
surgeon, Dr. Hemmeridge, came perilously near
to being badly scalded by Mr. Johnson, the
literary man, who, in reaching for a cup of tea
tilted the swinging tray. There was not
much talk, and what little was said chiefly
concerned the incident of the previous
evening.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain,&#8217; cried young Mr. Fairthorne in
an effeminate voice&mdash;he was the gentleman, it
seems, who last night had been calling upon
anybody to smother the ayah&mdash;&#8216;whath to
become of thothe poor Frenchmen?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; answered Captain Keeling in a
manner as stiff as a marline-spike with his
dislike of the subject, &#8216;I do not know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Frenchmen,&#8217; cried Colonel Bannister in a
loud voice, as though he were directing the
man&#339;uvres of a company of Sepoys, &#8216;are the
hereditary enemies of our country, and it
never can matter to a Briton what becomes of
them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Boot my tear sir,&#8217; remarked Mr. Hemskirk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
&#8216;you are a Briton, yes&mdash;and you are a
Christian too, und der Franchman iss your
broder.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My what?&#8217; roared the colonel. &#8216;Tell
ye what it is, Mr. Hemskirk: it is a good job
that you cannot pronounce our language,
otherwise you might happen sometimes, sir,
to grow offensive.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mynheer, who seemed to have had some
previous acquaintance with this little bombshell
of a man, dried the grease upon his lips
with a napkin, and cast a wink upon Mr.
Greenhew, whose face of resentment at this
familiarity caused me to break into such an
immoderate fit of laughter that there was
nothing for it but to bolt from the table.</p>

<p>I found a real Channel picture stretching
round me when I gained the deck; a grey
sky, lightened in places with a kind of suffusion
of radiance that made one think of the
rusty bronze lingering in the wake of an
expired sunset. Saving these flaws of dull
light, there was no break anywhere visible in
the wide cold bald stare of heaven over our
mastheads. The strong wind was a dry one,
yet the horizon was thick with a look of rain
all the way round; and out of the smother in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the south, the sea was rolling in heights of a
dark green, rich with creaming foam, that
somehow seemed to satisfy the eye, as though
each frothing crest were a streak of sunshine.
There was a smack half a mile to windward
of us staggering along and sinking and
rising under a fragment of red mainsail;
but there was nothing else to be seen in that
way.</p>

<p>The wind was blowing free for us&mdash;almost
dead abeam, indeed; and the <i>Countess Ida</i>
was swarming through it in a manner to put
a quicker beat into the heart at the first sight
of the picture she made. The topgallant-sail
was set over the single-reefed maintopsail; the
whole foresail was on her, and, with the other
topsails and a staysail or two, was tearing the
great ship through the short savage heapings
of water with a power that made one think of
steam as trifling by comparison. The forecastle
was wet with flying spray. The galley
chimney was smoking cheerily, and from all
about the long-boat came hearty farmyard
sounds of the grunting of pigs and the bleating
of sheep and the cackling of hens. There
was a gang of seamen at the pumps, and as
they plied the brakes with nervous sinewy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
arms, their song chimed in with the gushing
of the water flowing freely to the scuppers,
and washing back again to their feet with
every roll to windward. Other seamen were
at work upon the carronades, or cleaning
paint-work with scrubbing-brushes, or coiling
gear away upon pins, and so on, and so on.
It was after eight, and all hands were on deck,
and a fine set of livelies they looked, spite of
most of them being snugged up in black or
yellow oil-skins. Ships went with full companies
in those days, and but for the slenderness
of our ordnance, it might have been easy
to imagine one&#8217;s self on board a man-of-war
when one ran one&#8217;s eyes over the decks of the
<i>Countess Ida</i> and counted the crew, and
marked the butcher and butcher&#8217;s mates, the
cook and <i>his</i> mates, the baker and <i>his</i> mates,
the carpenter and <i>his</i> mates, coming and
going, and making a very fair of the neighbourhood
of the galley.</p>

<p>The second mate warmly clad paced the
weather side of the poop, sending many a
weatherly glance to seaward, with a frequent
lifting of his eyes to the rounded iron-hard
canvas; whilst against the brilliant white
wake of the ship, roaring and boiling upwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
as it seemed, to the stoop of the Indiaman&#8217;s
huge square counter, the figures of the two
sailors at the big wheel stood out clear-cut
as cameos, with the broad brass band upon
the circle dully reflecting a space of copperish
light in the sky over the weather mizzen-topsail
yard-arm, and the newly polished hood
of the binnacle gleaming as though sun-touched.
A couple of midshipmen in pea-coats
and brass buttons, curly headed young
rogues, with a spirit of mischief bright in
every glance they sent, patrolled the lee side
of the poop; and up in the mizzen top were
two more of them, with yet another long-legged
fellow jockeying a spur of the
cross-trees, with his loose trousers rattling like
a flag; but what job he was upon I could not
tell. The planks of this deck were as white
as the trunk of a tree newly stripped of its
bark. Four handsome quarter-boats swung
at the davits. Along the rail on either hand
went a row of hencoops, through the bars of
which the heads of cocks and hens came and
went in a winking sort of way, like a swift
showing and withdrawing of red rags. On
the rail, for a considerable distance, were
stowed bundles of compressed hay, the scent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of which was a real puzzle to the nose, coming
as it did through the hard sweep of the salt
wind. The white skylights glistened through
the intricacies of brass wire which shielded
them. Abaft the wheel, on either side of it,
their tompioned muzzles eyed blindly by the
closed ports meant to receive them, were a
couple of eighteen pounders; for in those
days the Indiamen still went armed; not
heavily, indeed, as in the war-times of an
earlier period, but with artillery and small-arms
enough to enable her to dispute with
some promise of success with the picaroon
who was still afloat, whose malignant flag
the burnished waters of the Antilles yet reflected,
and whose amiable company of assassins
were as often to be met with under the
African and South American heights as in
the Channel of the Mozambique, or eastward
yet on the broad surface of the Indian
Ocean.</p>

<p>I crossed the deck to where Mr. Cocker
was stumping, and asked him if he could tell
me off what part of the English coast our
ship now was.</p>

<p>&#8216;Drawing on to the Wight, sir,&#8217; he
answered, with a sort of groping look in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
little moist blue eyes he turned over the lee
bow into the thickness beyond.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, we&#8217;re blowing through it, anyway,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;I shouldn&#8217;t have allowed these heels
for any conceivable structure born with such
bows as the <i>Countess Ida</i>. What is it?&#8217; I
asked with a glance at the broad dazzle of
yeast dancing and whipping and slinging off
the Indiaman&#8217;s tall side against the hurl of the
weather surge.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;ll be all eight,&#8217; answered the second
officer: &#8216;it would be ten had she worked herself
loose of the grip of the stevedores. She
wants the mainsail and foreto&#8217;garn&#8217;sail. These
old buckets are manufactured to creak, and
whilst they creak, they hold, it is said.&#8217;</p>

<p>His face crumpled up into a grin that made
him look twenty years older under the thatch
of his sou&#8217;-wester curling to his eyebrows, with
the broad flaps over his ears like a nightcap
for his sea-helmet to sit upon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, Mr. Cocker,&#8217; said I, &#8216;was any
damage done to the ship by the collision last
night?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There wasn&#8217;t so much as a rope-yarn
parted,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;I looked to see the
spritsail yard sprung, for it&#8217;ll have been that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
spar, I reckon, which dragged the lugger&#8217;s
masts overboard by the shrouds of them. But
it&#8217;s as sound as anything else aboard the ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>He shifted uneasily, as though to make off,
and, turning my head, I spied the captain
looking into the binnacle. So, having had
already enough of the deck, I stepped below
for a smoke in the cuddy recess, where I found
Mr. Emmett in a long cloak, such as mysterious
assassins and renegade noblemen used to wear
at the Coburg Theatre, sucking at a large
curled meerschaum pipe, and arguing on the
subject of longitude with a little man almost a
dwarf, an honest and highly intelligent pigmy,
with the head of a giant supported on the legs
of a boy of six, an amiable earnest little
creature, with a trick of looking up wistfully
into your face. His name was Richard
Saunders: and I afterwards understood that
he was proceeding to India on behalf of some
Pharmaceutical Society, to collect information
on and examples of Hindu and other medicines,
drugs, charms, and so forth.</p>

<p>Well, all that day it continued to blow a
very strong wind. The ship&#8217;s plunging increased
as the Channel opened under her bow
and admitted something of the weight of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Atlantic in the run of its seas. There was a
constant sharp-shooting of spray forward over
the forecastle, and the wet came sobbing along;
the lee scuppers to where the cuddy front
checked it under the poop ladder. Very few
of us assembled at lunch or at dinner.</p>

<p>During the progress of this last meal,
Colonel Bannister left the table and went
below, and after an interval, uprose through
the hatch, with his large distinguished-looking
wife holding on to him. Mynheer Peter
Hemskirk, on seeing her, cried out: &#8216;Ah,
Meestrees Bannister, boot dot iss vot I call
plooky!&#8217; and Mr. Johnson came near to
breaking his neck whilst starting to his legs to
stand as she passed. She took a chair next
her husband, and sat grimly staring around
her, her lips pale with the compression of
them. She shook her head to every suggestion
made by the steward, and then, being
unable to hold out any longer, seized hold of
her little ramrod of a husband and went
staggering and rolling below with him. When
he returned, he tossed down a glass of wine
with an angry gesture and a fierce countenance,
and looking at Hemskirk, cried out:
&#8216;I&#8217;ve a great respect for my wife, sir, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
she&#8217;s a fine woman in every sense of the word.&#8217;&mdash;The
Dutchman nodded.&mdash;&#8216;But,&#8217; continued
the colonel, clenching his fist, &#8216;if ever I go to
sea with a woman again, be she wife, aunt, or
grandmother, may I be poisoned for a lunatic,
and my remains committed to the deep. This
is the fourth time I&#8217;ve sworn it&mdash;my mind is
now resolved!&#8217;</p>

<p>Out of all this sort of thing one could get
a laugh here and there; but on the whole it
was desperately weary work, and continued so
till we had blown clear of soundings. Altogether,
it was as ugly a down Channel run as
any man would pray to be preserved from;
the atmosphere grey, the seas a muddy green,
the howling blast chill as a November morn,
often darkening to a squall, that would sweep
between the masts in horizontal lines of rain
sparkling like steel, and with spite enough in
the lancing of them to compel the strongest to
turn his back. Now and again a lady passenger
would show in the cuddy; but though
there were some twenty-eight of us in all, not
reckoning a couple of ayahs, and a Chinaman
in the garb of his country, who acted as nurse
to one Mrs. Trevor&#8217;s baby, never once in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
days did above seven of us, barring the skipper
and his mates, sit down to a meal.</p>

<p>The thick weather lay heavily upon the
captain&#8217;s mind, held him in fits of abstraction
whilst at table, dismissed him after a brief
sitting to the deck, and kept him heedful and
taciturn whilst there. He had had one
collision, and wanted no more; and you would
notice how that tragedy had served him, by
observing him when in the cuddy to prick up
his ears to the least unusual noise on deck, to
glance at the tell-tale compass over his head,
as though it were the sun which he had been
patiently waiting for a chance to &#8216;shoot,&#8217; to
swallow his food with impatient motions to
the steward to bear a hand, and to bolt up the
cabin steps without a smile or syllable of
apology to us for quitting the table.</p>

<small>LOUISE TEMPLE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">But</span> there came a change at last. Ushant
was then many long leagues astern, and the
night had been dark but quiet, with a long
Biscayan swell brimming to our starboard
quarter, and a play of sheet-lightning off the
lee bow, and wind enough to send the Indiaman
through it at some six knots with her
royals and cross-jack furled and the weather
clew of her mainsail up. This was as the
picture showed when I went to bed at five
bells&mdash;half-past ten&mdash;and on opening my eyes
next morning I found the berth brilliant with
sunshine, bulkhead and ceiling trembling to
the glory rippling off the sea through the
large round scuttle or porthole, and the
action of the ship a stately gliding, with a
slow long floating heave that raised no sound
whatever of creak or straining, and that, after
the long spell of tumblefication, was as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
grateful to every sense and to all wearied
bones as the firm unrocking surface of dry
land.</p>

<p>Mr. Colledge was shaving himself. I lay
eyeing him for a few minutes, admiring the
handsome high-born looks of the youth, and
thinking it was a pity that such manly beauty
as his should lack the consecrating touch of
an intellectual expression to parallel his
physical graces. He saw me in the glass in
which he was scraping himself.</p>

<p>&#8216;Good-morning, Dugdale. I feel all right
again, d&#8217;ye know. I am going to eat my
breakfast in the cuddy and then go on
deck.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Glad to hear it,&#8217; said I, putting my legs
over the side of the bunk.</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose there&#8217;ll be some girls about
this morning,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Who the dooce are
the passengers, I wonder? Anybody very
nice aboard, not counting that ripping young
lady with the black eyes?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nearly everybody&#8217;s been as sea-sick as
you,&#8217; said I; &#8216;and the few who have put
in an appearance are males&mdash;your friend
Emmett, the fat Dutchman, and two or three
others.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>&#8216;Oh, you mean Mynheer Hemskirk, the
corpulent chap, whose voice sounds like that
of a man inside a rum puncheon talking
through the bunghole.&#8217;</p>

<p>I asked him if he could tell me anything
about Miss Temple, the black-eyed lady.</p>

<p>&#8216;Some one told me at Gravesend,&#8217; he
answered&mdash;&#8216;but I don&#8217;t know who it was&mdash;that
she&#8217;s a daughter of Sir Conyers Temple.
I think I&#8217;ve heard my father speak of him as
a man he has hunted with. If he&#8217;s that Sir
Conyers, he broke his neck four years ago in
a steeplechase.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who accompanies the young lady to
India, I wonder?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Her aunt, I believe; but I don&#8217;t know
her name. But I say, though, what makes
you so inquisitive?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, my dear Colledge,&#8217; said I, &#8216;one is
always inquisitive about one&#8217;s fellow-passengers
on board ship. The girl came
up to me on deck the other night when the
row of the collision was in full swing. I see
her big eyes now&mdash;black as ebony, yet
luminous too, with the flame of a flare-tin at
the side reflected in each magnificent orb in
a spot of crimson which made her pale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
hooded face as mystical as a vision of the
night.&#8217;</p>

<p>He turned to stare at me, and broke into
a laugh. &#8216;So! <i>you</i> are the poet amongst the
passengers, eh? as Emmett&#8217;s the painter?
What&#8217;s to be <i>my</i> walk? Oh, there goes the
first breakfast bell! Heaven bless us, what a
delightful thing it is not to feel sea-sick!&#8217;</p>

<p>We continued to gabble a bit in this
fashion; he then left the berth, and a little
later I followed him.</p>

<p>The large cuddy wore an aspect it had
not before exhibited. The sunshine sparkled
upon the skylights, and the interior was full
of the blue and silver radiance of the rich
and welcome autumn morning outside. The
long table was all aglow with the silver and
crystal furniture of the white damask, and
through the glazed domes in the upper deck
you could see the canvas on the mizzen
swelling in a milky softness from yard to yard
as the sails mounted to the height of the
tender little royal.</p>

<p>The passengers came from the deck or up
from below one after another; the change in
the weather had acted as a charm, and here
now was the whole mob of us, one old lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
excepted, with a glimpse to be had of the
two ayahs sunning themselves on the quarter-deck.
The skipper, looking a bit stale, as
with too much of all-night work, but smart
enough in the gingerbread trickery of his
uniform, made a little speech of compliments
to the ladies and gentlemen from the head of
the table. There was a courtliness about the
old fellow that gained not a little in relish
from a sort of deep-sea flavour in his manner
and varying expressions of face. I liked
the quality of the bow with which he accompanied
his answer to any lady who addressed
him.</p>

<p>I sat at the bottom of the table on the
right hand of the chief-officer, and was able to
command a pretty good view of the people
that I was to be associated with, as I might
suppose, for the next three or four, and
perhaps five months. There were several
girls amongst us&mdash;two Miss Joliffes, three
Miss Brookes&#8217;s, Miss Hudson, and four or five
more. Miss Hudson was exceedingly pretty&mdash;hair
of dark gold, and a skin delicate as a
lily, upon which lay a kind of golden tinge&mdash;oh,
call it not freckles! though I daresay
the charming effect was produced by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
something of that sort. Her eyes were large,
moist, violet in hue, with slightly lifted eyebrows,
which gave them an arch look. Mr.
Sylvanus Johnson, who sat next me, after
staring at her a little, muttered in my ear in
a dramatic undertone: &#8216;Perdita has expressed
that girl, sir:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="indent13">Violets dim,</div>
<div class="verse">But sweeter than the lids of Juno&#8217;s eyes</div>
<div class="verse">Or Cytherea&#8217;s breath.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8216;If that be her mother next to her,&#8217; said
I, &#8216;fix your attention upon her, Mr. Johnson,
and Perdita&#8217;s fancy will exhale!&#8217;</p>

<p>And indeed Mrs. Hudson was a very
extraordinary, and I may say violent contrast
to her daughter: a pursy lady of about fifty,
with a heavy underlip, puffed-out cheeks of a
bluish tint, and a wig, the youthful hue of
which defined every trace of age in her
countenance, till one thought of her as being
some score years older than she really was.</p>

<p>But the interior was wonderfully humanised
by these ladies. Their dress, the sparkle
of jewels in their ears, on their fingers and
throats, here and there a turban seated high
on some motherly head&mdash;it was the age of
turbans and feathers&mdash;the soft notes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
girls running an undertone of music through
the deeper voices of the matrons and the
growling of us males grumbling conversation
across and up the table, whipped the fancy
ashore, and made one think of drawing-rooms
and guitars and Books of Beauty.</p>

<p>There was one lady, however, who held
my eye from the start. She was Miss Louise
Temple, and I cannot express how deep was
the admiration her charms excited in me. I
told you that I had caught a glimpse of her
at Gravesend; but, down to this moment, I
had been unable to obtain a fair view of her.
Her hair that, to judge by the coils of it, when
let down would have reached to below her
knees, was of a wonderful blackness without
either gloss or deadness. She wore it in a
manner that was perfectly new in those days:
in twinings which heaped it up to the aspect
of a crown; whilst behind it was brushed up
in a way to exhibit the lovely form of the
head from the curve of the neck to where the
beautiful tresses lay piled. Her face was perfectly
colourless, the complexion clear, and
the skin exquisitely delicate. Her mouth was
small, the upper lip slightly curved, and there
was the hint of a pout in the faint, scarce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
perceptible protrusion of the under lip. Her
nose was perfectly straight, like a Greek
woman&#8217;s; but it had the English indent under
the brow, and therefore had the beauty, which
to my fancy, no Greek profile ever yet possessed.</p>

<p>But her eyes! How am I to describe
them? What impression can I hope to convey
by such terms as large, black, soft, and
fluid? The lids were delicately veined, the
eyelashes long, and between these fringes the
eyes shone of a dark liquid loveliness, full of
the light, as it seemed to me, of a high intelligence,
with spirit and haughtiness in every
glance. They were the most dramatic, by
which I do not mean theatric, pair of twinklers
that ever sparkled star-like under the beauty
of a woman&#8217;s brow; created, you might have
thought, for the interpretation of the Shakespearean
imaginations, with all capacity in
them of surprise, scorn, resentment, melting
tenderness, and of every fine and noble passion.
She was attired in a dress of black cloth,
simple as a riding habit of to-day, and so
fitting her figure as to express without exaggeration
every point of grace in the curves
and fulness of her tall but still maidenly form.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>I caught her glance for a moment: I am
sure she remembered me as the passenger she
had addressed on the poop; yet there was not
the faintest expression of recognition in the
full, firm, swift stare she honoured me with.
She looked away from me as haughtily as a
queen, with flashing inspection of the others
of the row of us that confronted her, though
it seemed to me that her gaze lingered a little
on the Honourable Mr. Colledge, who was
seated immediately opposite.</p>

<p>&#8216;I reckon now,&#8217; whispered Mr. Prance,
leaning to me in his chair from his athwart-ship
post at the foot of the table, &#8216;that
yonder Miss Temple will be about the handsomest
woman that was ever afloat.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There have been many thousands of
women afloat,&#8217; said I, &#8216;since Noah got
under way with the ladies of his family
aboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have been sailing in passenger-ships,&#8217;
said he,&#8216;for nineteen years come next month,
and have never before seen such a figure-head
as Miss Temple&#8217;s. What teeth she has!
Little teeth, sir, as all women&#8217;s should be;
and where&#8217;s the whiteness that&#8217;s to be compared
to them?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>&#8216;Who is that homely, pleasant-faced
woman sitting by her side?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Her aunt, Mrs. Radcliffe,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;What errand carries that stately creature
to India, do you know, Mr. Prance?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not very likely,&#8217; I continued, &#8216;that she&#8217;s
bound out in search of a husband.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no,&#8217; he muttered. &#8216;The like of her
have a big enough market at home to command.
No need for <i>her</i> to cross the ocean to
find a sweetheart. She&#8217;s the daughter of a
dead baronet, a tenth title, so the captain was
saying; and her mother has a large estate to
live on. Captain Keeling knows all about
them. Her ladyship was seized with paralysis
when her husband was brought home
with his neck broken, and has been a sheer
hulk ever since, I believe, poor thing. We
brought Mrs. Radcliffe to England last voyage.
Her husband&#8217;s a big planter up country, and
worth a lac or two. I expect Miss Temple
is going out on a visit&mdash;nothing more. Her
health may need a voyage. Those choice bits
of mechanism often go wrong in their works.
She wants a stroke of colour in her cheeks.
&#8217;Tis the scent of the milkmaid that she lacks, sir.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>He gave a pleasant nod, quietly rose, and
went on deck by way of the cuddy front, to
relieve the second officer, who was watching
the ship for him whilst he breakfasted.</p>

<p>At such a first meal as this, so to speak,
when, barring one, we had all come together
for the first time, there was no want of British
reserve and shyness. We chiefly contented
ourselves with staring. Colonel Bannister
alone talked freely; he was loud on the subject
of army grievances, and was rendered
indeed, intolerably fluent and noisy by the
respectful attention he received from a
gentleman who sat over against him, one
Mr. Hodder, a tall, thin, nervous, yellow-faced
man, with a paralytic catching up of
his breath in his speech, who was going to
India to fill some post of responsibility in
a college. Mrs. Bannister with her hawks-bill
nose, grey hair, and full figure, sat bolt
upright, eating with avidity, and sweeping
the faces round about her with a small
severe eye.</p>

<p>I watched little Mrs. Radcliffe with attention.
It was not hard to guess that she was an amiable,
fidgety, anxious body, of elastic properties
of mind, easily, but only temporarily, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
be repressed. She talked in a quick way to
her niece, darting what she had to say into
the girl&#8217;s ear, with an abrupt withdrawal of
her head, and an earnest look at Miss Temple&#8217;s
face. The other would sometimes faintly
smile, but for the most part her air was one
of haughty abstraction. Indeed, it was easy
to see that, so far as her opinion of her fellow-passengers
went, it was not quite flattering to
the bulk of us.</p>

<p>It was a noble morning, indeed, on deck.
There was a long blue heave of swell from
the northward, quiet as the rise and fall of a
sleeper&#8217;s breast, and the white buttons of the
ship&#8217;s trucks, glancing like silver against the
moist blue of the sky, swung so slowly and
tenderly to and fro that one could almost
watch them without perception of any movement.
The ocean was of a deep sea blue, all
to eastward flashing under the sun, and the
small waves chased us with a voice of summer
in the caressing seething of the snow of their
heads against the sides of the Indiaman. The
ship had studdingsails set, and under these
far overhanging wings the water trembled
back the radiance that fell from the swelling
cloths, as though there were a floating thinness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of quicksilver there prismatic as a soap-bubble.</p>

<p>Very soon after breakfast the poop was
filled, and I marked the Jacks forward staring
aft at the sight of us all. It was not hot
enough for an awning, and there was still too
much edge in the breeze, warmly as the sun
looked down, to suffer the ladies to sit for any
length of time. The picture was a cheerful
one, full of movement and life and colour.
The white-headed skipper, skewered up in his
bebuttoned and belaced frock-coat, patrolled
the weather side of the deck with Mrs. Radcliffe
on his arm. Mr. Emmett paced the
planks with Mrs. Joliffe and her daughters,
and I could hear him bidding them admire
the contrast between the violet shadowing in
the hollows of the sails and the delicate sheen
of the edges against the blue, as though at
those extremities they dissolved into pure
lustre. Little Mr. Saunders trotted alongside
the orbicular form of Mynheer Hemskirk,
who showed as a giant as he looked down
into the earnest upstaring face of the big-headed
little chap. Three Civil Service youths
lounged upon a hencoop, looking askant at the
young ladies, and laughing under their breaths<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
at what one or another of them said. Near
the foremost skylight stood Mr. Johnson and
Colonel Bannister. One did not need to listen
attentively to understand that the colonel
was falling foul of the calling of journalism,
and that Mr. Johnson was endeavouring
to defend it by repeating over and over again:
&#8216;Granted&mdash;I admit it&mdash;I&#8217;m not going to say
no; but give me leave to ask, where on earth
would your profession be, sir, if its actions
were not chronicled?&#8217; These remarks he
continued to reiterate till the colonel was in
a white heat, and I had to walk away to conceal
my laughter.</p>

<p>As I passed the companion hatchway,
which you will please to understand is the
hooded entrance to the cuddy by way of the
poop, Miss Temple came up out of it, closely
followed by Mr. Colledge. There was something
like a smile on her pale face, and he
was talking with animation. She wore a
black hat, wide at the brim, with a large
black feather encircling it, and a sort of jacket
with some rich trimming of dark fur upon it.
I was close enough to overhear them as they
emerged.</p>

<p>&#8216;I quite remember my dear father speaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of Lord Sandown,&#8217; she said, coming to a
stand at the head of the companion steps,
and sending a sparkling sweeping look along
the decks. &#8216;Is not Lady Isabella FitzJames
an aunt of yours, Mr. Colledge?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes. I hope you don&#8217;t know her,&#8217; he
answered. &#8216;She writes books, you know,
and fancies herself a wit; and her conversation
is as parching as the seedcake she used
to give me when I was a boy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have met her,&#8217; said Miss Temple.
&#8216;I rather liked her. Perhaps she neglects
to be clever in the company of her own
sex.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ever been to India before?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; she answered in a voice whose note
of affability somehow by no means softened
her haughty regard of the passengers as they
walked past. &#8216;I am entirely obliging my
aunt by undertaking the trip. My uncle is
very old, and too infirm to make the passage
to England, and he was extremely anxious for
my mother and me to spend some months
with him. Of course it was a ridiculous invitation
as far as poor mamma is concerned.
You know she is a helpless cripple, Mr.
Colledge.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>&#8216;Oh, indeed. I didn&#8217;t know. I am very
sorry, I&#8217;m sure,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall not remain long,&#8217; she continued;
&#8216;most probably I shall return in this ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;By George, though, I hope you will!&#8217;
he exclaimed. &#8216;I&#8217;m booked to come home in
her too. There&#8217;ll be more shooting in three
months than I shall want, you know. I mean
to pot a few tigers, and try my hand on a
wild elephant or two. By Jove, Miss Temple,
if you&#8217;ll allow me, you shall have the skin of
the first tiger I shoot!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, you are too good, Mr. Colledge,&#8217;
said she, with a smile trembling on her parted
lips, lifting her hand as she spoke to smooth
a streak of hair off her forehead with fingers
that sparkled with rings; but her eyes were
brighter than any of her gems; they turned
at that instant full upon me as I stood looking
at her a little way past the mizzen-mast, and
there seemed something of positive insolence
in the brief stare she fixed upon me; the faint
smile vanished to the curl of her upper lip as
she turned her head.</p>

<p><i>That</i>, my fine madam, thought I, may be
your manner of regarding everything which is
not to be found in the Peerage.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>Colledge, who had followed her glance,
saw me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Dugdale,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;can you tell me
anything about tigers&#8217; skins&mdash;how long it
takes to doctor them into rugs and all that
sort of thing, don&#8217;t you know?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I can tell you nothing about tigers&#8217; skins,&#8217;
said I curtly. &#8216;I have never seen a tiger.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Know anything about lions&#8217; skins, then?&#8217;
he sung out with a half-smile, meant, as my
temper fancied, for Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;The ass in the fable clothed himself in
one, I believe,&#8217; said I, &#8216;but his roar betrayed
him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now I come to think of it,&#8217; said he, &#8216;I
believe there are no lions in India;&#8217; and he
looked from me to the girl with a face of
interrogation so full of good temper as to
satisfy me that at heart he was a kindly-natured
young fellow.</p>

<p>&#8216;I think I shall walk, Mr. Colledge,&#8217; said
Miss Temple.</p>

<p>They joined the folks promenading the
weather-deck, and I went to the recess under
the poop to smoke a pipe.</p>

<p>I leaned in a sulky mood against the bulkhead.
There was a sense upon me as of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
having been snubbed. I was a young man in
those days, of an uncomfortably sensitive disposition.
Yet there should have been virtue
enough in that glorious morning to soothe in
one&#8217;s soul a keener sting than was to be
inflicted by a handsome woman&#8217;s scornful
glance. The slight leaning away of the ship
from the soft breeze showed a space over the
bulwark rails of the sparkling azure under the
sun steeping to the delicate silver blue of the
sky, with a small star-like point of white in
the far-off airy dazzle, marking the topmost
cloths of a ship out there. The white planks
under my feet had the glistening look of sand,
now that the decks had been washed down,
and had dried out into a frosting of themselves,
as it were, with tiny crystals of brine. The
shadows of the rigging in ink-black lines swung
sleepily to the motion of the fabric. The
Chinaman nurse, in a gown of blue, and wide
blue trousers, and primrose-coloured face, and
a gleaming tail like a dead black serpent lying
down his back, leaned against a carronade,
tossing the little baby he had charge of till the
plump little sweet crowed again with delight.
On the warm tarpaulin over the main-hatch sat
the two ayahs, crooning over the infants they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
held, often lifting their eyes, like beads of unpolished
indigo stuck into slips of mottled
soap, to the poop, where the mothers of their
youngsters were. There was a taste as of a
hubble-bubble in the air, with the faint relish
of bamboo chafing-gear and cocoa-nut ropes.
The hubble-bubble, I daresay, was a fancy
wrought by the spectacle of those black faces,
and helped by a noise of parrots somewhere
aft.</p>

<p>A length of sail was stretched along the
waist, and upon it were seated several sailors,
flourishing palms and needles as they stitched.
They talked together in a low voice that the
mate of the watch should not hear them. At
one of the fellows who sat with his face towards
me, I found myself looking as at a curiosity
that slowly compels the attention, spite of any
heedless mood you may be in. Many ugly
mariners had I met in my time, but never the
like of that man. His right eye had a lamentable
cast; his back was so round that I imagined
he had a hunch. He had enormously
long strong arms, with immense fists at the
ends of them, and the sleeves of his shirt being
rolled to above his elbow exposed a score of
extraordinary devices in Indian ink writhing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
amongst the hair that lay in places like fur
upon the flesh. The bridge of his nose had
been crushed to his face, and a mere knob with
two holes in it stood out about an inch above
his hare-lip. Though manifestly an old sailor,
salted down for ship&#8217;s use by years of seafaring,
his complexion was dingy and dough-like as
the skin of a London baker, with nothing distinctive
upon it saving a number of warts, and
a huge mole over a ridge of scarlet eyebrow
dashed with a few grey hairs. His hair, that
was of coarse brick-red, hung down upon his
back, as though, forsooth, the ship&#8217;s cook had
made a wig for him out of the parings of
carrots. Indeed, he was as much a monster
as anything that was ever shut up in a cage
and carried about as a show.</p>

<p>I was watching him with growing interest,
wondering to myself what sort of a life such
a creature as that had led, what kind of ships
he had sailed in chiefly, and how so grotesque
an object had been suffered to &#8216;sign on&#8217; for an
Indiaman, in which one might expect to find
something of a man-of-war uniformity and
smartness of crew, when Mr. Sylvanus Johnson
came out from the cuddy, rolling an unlighted
cheroot betwixt his lips.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>&#8216;See that chap sitting upon the sail yonder?&#8217;
said I&mdash;&#8216;a good subject for a leading article,
Mr. Johnson.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh confound it, Mr. Dugdale; no sneers,
if you please. Let me light this cigar at your
pipe. That fellow is in Emmett&#8217;s way, not
mine. Quite a triumph of hideousness, I
protest. But what&#8217;s the matter with you, this
lovely morning? You look a bit down in the
mouth, Mr. Dugdale. Not going to be sea-sick, I
hope, now that all the rest of us have recovered?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Down in the mouth? Not I. But I&#8217;ll
tell you what, Mr. Johnson&mdash;when you take
charge of your newspaper, will you be so good
as to inform the world that there is nothing
under the broad sky more consumedly insipid
than the chattering of a young man and a
young woman when they first meet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, how now?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, my dear sir,&#8217; cried I, &#8216;hear them.
The unspeakable drivel of it&mdash;the &#8220;reallys&#8221;
and &#8220;oh dears&#8221; and &#8220;yes quites&#8221;&#8217;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said Mr. Johnson looking at the ash
of his cigar after every puff; &#8216;I think I know
what you mean. But it is the effect of politeness,
I believe. A young gentleman and a
young lady who desire to please will begin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
very low with each other, lest they should
prove disconcerting. But what d&#8217;ye say&#8217;&mdash;he
lowered his voice&mdash;&#8216;to the drivel, as you
call it, of a man of advanced years?&#8217;&mdash;here
he looked into the cuddy, then took a step
forward to peer up at the poop&mdash;&#8216;of a person
who has seen the world&mdash;of a colonel, in short?
I wish to be on good terms with my fellow-passengers;
but if that man Bannister goes on
as he has begun, I&#8217;m afraid&mdash;I&#8217;m afraid it will
end in my having to pull his nose.&#8217;</p>

<p>He sent another nervous look into the
cuddy and frowned upon his cigar end.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has he been offensive?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, judge,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;when I tell
you that he said there wasn&#8217;t a respectable man
connected with journalism; that the calling
was distinctly a tipsy one; that his idea of a
journalist was that of a man lying in bed till
his only shirt came from the wash, and inventing
lies to publish to the world when the
washerwoman enabled him to clothe himself.&mdash;&#8220;And
pray, sir,&#8221; said I, sneering at him,
&#8220;what would the country know of your
military achievements if it were not for the
journalist? You army gentlemen profess to
despise him; but you will get up very early<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
to buy his paper if you have a notion that
there will be any mention of your doings in
it.&#8221;&mdash;That was pretty warm, I think?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Rather,&#8217; said I; &#8216;and what did he say?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He answered that if any other man but
myself had said as much, he would have told
him to go and be damned.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I hope the passengers may
prove a companionable body, I am sure. For
my part, it is more likely than not that my
place of abode whilst the weather permits will
be the foretop. Anything to escape overhearing
the insipidity of a chat between a
young man and a young woman when they
first meet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I see,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that your friend Colledge
has hooked himself on to Miss Temple. I
should say he needs to be the son of a nobleman
to make headway with such a Cleopatra
as her ladyship. Fine eyes, perhaps; but a
little pale, eh? Give me Miss Hudson. I
don&#8217;t admire the sneering part of the sex.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nor I,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;But every woman,&#8217; said he, &#8216;has a way
of her own of making love. Some simper
themselves into a man&#8217;s affection, and some
triumph by scorn and contempt. Do you remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
how the Duchess of Cleveland made
love to Wycherley? She put her head out
of the coach window and cried out to him:
&#8220;Sir, you&#8217;re a rascal, you&#8217;re a villain!&#8221; and
Pope tells us that Wycherley from that moment
entertained hopes.&#8217;</p>

<p>But by this time my pipe was smoked out;
and catching sight of Mynheer Hemskirk and
a passenger named Adams, a lawyer, coming
down the ladder with the notion as I might
guess of joining us in the recess that was the
one smoking-room of the ship, I bolted forwards,
got upon the forecastle, and overhung
the rail, where I lay for a long half-hour
lazily enjoying the sight of the massive cutwater
of the Indiaman rending the brilliant
blue surface, with a clear lift of azure water
either hand of her, that broke into a little
running stream of foam abreast of the cat-heads,
and swarmed quietly aft in foam-bells
and winking bubbles, that made one think of
the froth at the foot of a cascade gliding along
the crystal-clear breast of a stream to the
murmur of summer leaves and the horn-like
hum of insects.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br />

<small>A MYSTERIOUS VOICE</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Well,</span> all that day the weather held fine and
clear; indeed, we might have been on the
Madeira parallels; and I said to Mr. Prance
that it was enough to make one keep a bright
look-out for the flying fish. The sky was of
a wonderful softness of blue, piebald in the
main, with small snow-like puffs of cloud
flying low, as though they were a fog that
had broken up. A large black ship passed
us in the afternoon. She was close hauled,
and, being to leeward, showed to perfection
when she came abreast. Her sails seemed to
be formed of cotton cloth, and mounted in
three spires to little skysails, with a crowd of
fleecy jibs curving at the bowsprit and jib-booms,
and many stay-sails between the masts
softly shadowed like a drawing in pencil. The
lustre lifting off the sea was reverberated in a
row of scuttles, and the flash of the glass was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
so like the yellow blaze of a gun that you
started to the sight, and strained your ear an
instant for the report.</p>

<p>She was too far off to hail. The captain,
standing in the midst of a crowd of ladies,
said that she was an American, and told the
second officer, who had the watch, to make
the <i>Countess Ida&#8217;s</i> number.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, what a lovely string of flags!&#8217; exclaimed
Miss Hudson, who stood near me,
following with her languishing violet eyes the
soaring of the mani-coloured bunting as it rose
to the block of the peak signal halliards like
the tail of a kite. &#8216;Is there anybody very
important in that ship that we are honouring
him with that pretty display?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I, laughing, as I let my gaze
sink fair into the sweet depths of her wonderful
peepers. &#8216;By means of those flags the
<i>Countess Ida</i> is telling yonder craft who she
is, so that when she arrives home she may
report us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, how heavenly! Only think of a ship
being made to tell her name! Oh mamma,&#8217;
she cried, making a step to catch hold of her
mother&#8217;s gown, and to give it a tweak, as the
old lady stood at the rail gazing at the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
vessel from the ambush of a large bonnet,
shaped like a coal-scuttle; &#8216;imagine, dear:
Mr. Dugdale says that the <i>Countess Ida</i> is
telling that ship who she is. How clever men
are&mdash;particularly sailors. I love sailors.&#8217;</p>

<p>Her melting eyes sought the deck, and
the long lashes drooped in a tender shadow of
beauty upon the faint golden tinge of her
cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8216;La, now, to think of it!&#8217; cried Mrs. Hudson.
&#8216;Well, those who go down into the sea,
as the saying is, do certainly see some wonderful
things.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here Mr. Colledge, who did not know, I
suppose, that I was conversing with these
ladies, came up to me and said: &#8216;By the way,
Dugdale, what was that joke of yours about
the lion&#8217;s skin this morning? Miss Temple
says it was meant for a joke; but hang me if
I can see any point in it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What did I say?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>He repeated the remark.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes; the young lady is right,&#8217; said I,
sending a look at her as she stood near the
wheel by her aunt&#8217;s side&mdash;the pair of them
well away from the rest of us&mdash;gazing through
a pair of delicate little opera glasses at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
Yankee; &#8216;it was a joke. What a capital
memory you have. But as to point, it had
none, and the joke, my dear fellow, lies in
that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he, &#8216;it makes a man feel like
an ass to miss a good thing when a lady is
standing by who can see it clearly enough to
laugh at it afterwards.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; I exclaimed; &#8216;very true indeed.
What a fine picture that ship makes, eh?
There goes her answering pennant! Let them
say what they will of Jonathan, he has a trick
high above the art of John Bull in shipbuilding.&#8217;</p>

<p>I watched his handsome face as he peered
at her. He turned to me and said: &#8216;D&#8217;ye
know, there&#8217;s a doocid lot of humour in the
idea of the point of a joke lying in its having
no point;&#8217; and with that he went over to
Miss Temple, whose haughty face softened into
a smile to his approach; and there for some
time the three of them stood, he ogling the
American (that was slowly slipping into toy-like
dimensions upon our quarter) through
the girl&#8217;s binocular; whilst she talked with
him, as I could tell by the movement of her
lips, Mrs. Radcliffe meanwhile looking on with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
fidgety motions of her head, and frequent
glances at her niece, the nervous interrogative
slightly troubled character of which was as
suggestive to me as to how it stood between
them, as if she had come to my side and
whipped out that she was really afraid that
Louise&#8217;s character would make the charge of
her a worry and a perplexity.</p>

<p>There was a noble sunset that evening,
in the west lay stretched a delicate curtain of
cloud linked in shapes of shell, with dashes
here and there as of mare&#8217;s tails; whilst near
the sea-line the vapour was more compacted,
still linked, but with a closer inwreathing, as
like to chain armour as anything I can compare
it to. When the sun sank into this
exquisite lace of vapour, it lighted up a
hundred colours all over it, which transformed
the whole of the western heavens into a most
gorgeous and dazzling tapestry. Never saw I
before the like of such a sunset. But for the
visible circle of the glowing mass of the orb,
you would have thought those glorious shooting
hues, those astonishing and sumptuous emissions
of green and gold and purple, of rose
and brilliant yellow and shining blue fainting
into an unimaginably delicate texture of green,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
some phenomenal exhibition of electric splendour.
The sea glowed under this vast display
of western magnificence in fifty superb hues.
We all stood looking, whilst the wondrous
pageant slowly faded, the ship meanwhile reflecting
the splendour in her sails till they
showed like yellow satin against the soft
evening blue gathering over the mastheads, as
she pushed softly through the water, the oil-smooth
surface of her wake lined with the
spume broken out by the passage of her bows
lifting tenderly on the swell that was flowing
in long lines to the ship from out of the north-west.</p>

<p>The moon rose late, but it was a fine clear
starlit dusk when eight bells of the second
dog-watch floated along the decks and echoed
quietly down out of the wind-hushed spaces
of the canvas. The sea swept black to its
confines where the low wheeling stars were
hovering like ships&#8217; lights in the immeasurable
distance. The radiance of the cuddy lamps
flung a sheen upon the quarter-deck atmosphere;
but away forward from abreast of the
mainmast the ship lay black in the shadow of
her own canvas, with a view of a few dark
blotches of the forms of men moving about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the forecastle, their figures showing out against
the brilliant dust in the sky under the wide
yawn of the fore-course.</p>

<p>Old Keeling was pacing the deck with
studdingsails out on both sides, as Jack says,
that is to say, with a lady on either arm.
Other figures moved here and there; and Mr.
Cocker, who had charge of the deck, walked
to and fro from rail to rail with the young
fourth officer by his side, regularly pausing,
ere swinging round for the stump back, to
take a peep under the foot of the mainsail or
to send a long look into the weather horizon.
Little Mr. Saunders came up to me, spoke of
the beauty of the evening, and asked me to
walk. He was a very intelligent little chap,
and had written several works on the superstitions
of various peoples in relation to their
treatment of diseases. He was wonderfully in
earnest in all he said, and would again and
again in his enthusiasm come to a stand, raise
his arm to catch hold of a button of my coat,
as if to detain me, meanwhile standing on the
tips of his toes and peering up into my face.
On the other side of the deck walked my
friend Colledge between Miss Temple and her
aunt. Three of the Civil Service gentlemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
were in tow of Mrs. Brookes and her
daughters; and right aft, leaning in picturesque
attitude against one of the guns, was
Mr. Sylvanus Johnson airily and in a gallant
tone of voice explaining to Mrs. and Miss
Hudson how it was that the sun and moon
were sometimes to be seen shining together.
Down in the cuddy, directly under the after-skylight,
sat Colonel Bannister playing whist
with his wife, Mr. Hodder, and Mr. Adams;
and almost every time I passed I could hear
the military man&#8217;s voice remonstrating with
one or the other of them for having played
such or such a card: &#8216;You should have led
the knave, sir. What on earth, my dear,
made you trump spades? No, no; I was
right! I believe I am not to be taught whist
at my time of life, sir;&#8217; and so on, and so on.</p>

<p>By-and-by a bell rang to summon the
passengers below to such refreshments of wine
and biscuits and strong waters as they chose
to partake of. The promenaders in shadowy
forms melted down the companion hatchway,
and two or three of us only remained on deck.
Mr. Colledge was one of them. He came over
to me, staring in my face, to make sure of me,
and exclaimed: &#8216;I wish they would allow a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
man to smoke up here. What is the evil in a
pipe of tobacco or a cheroot, that you must go
and sneak into a dark corner to light it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How is it that you are not below with
Miss Temple?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said he, laughing, &#8216;I want to make
her last me out the voyage, and that won&#8217;t be
done, you know, if we see too much of each
other.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You are to be congratulated,&#8217; said I, &#8216;on
the compliment she pays you:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Favours to none, to none she smiles extends;</div>
<div class="verse">Oft she rejects, and oftener still offends.</div>
</div></div>

<p>That&#8217;s not exactly how the poet puts it, but it
is apter than the original.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh well, you know, Dugdale, she has met
some of my people. I don&#8217;t dislike her for
holding off. It shows that her blood and
instincts are English; though, faith, when I
first saw her I took her to be a Spaniard.
Between you and me, though, the golden
headed girl&#8217;s the belle of the ship. What&#8217;s her
name?&mdash;Ah! Miss Hudson. Look at her
as she sits in the light down there! Why,
now, if I had your poetical turn, how would
I spout whole yards about her fingers like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
snowflakes, and her lips like&mdash;&mdash; But see
here! there&#8217;s nothing new in the shape of
imagery to apply to a pretty woman. Oh
yes! Miss Hudson&#8217;s the ship&#8217;s beauty. But
Miss Temple is ripping company, and, my
stars! what eyes!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Take care,&#8217; said I, laughing, &#8216;that you
don&#8217;t do what the man who marries the
deceased wife&#8217;s sister always does&mdash;wed the
wrong one. Choose correctly at the start.&#8217;</p>

<p>He burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am already engaged to be married,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;What single man of judgment
would dare adventure a voyage to Bombay
without securing himself in that fashion
against all risks?&#8217;</p>

<p>I stared into his grinning face, as we stood
at the skylight, to discover if he was in
earnest.</p>

<p>&#8216;Keep your secret, Colledge,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I&#8217;ll
not peach.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here the second-mate interrupted us by
singing out an order to the watch to haul
down the fore and main topgallant studdingsails.
Then he took in his lower and main
topmast studdingsails. The men&#8217;s noisy bawling
made talking difficult, and Colledge went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
below for a glass of brandy-and-water.
Presently old Keeling came on deck, and after
a look around, and a pretty long stare over
the weather bow, where there was a very
faint show of lightning, he said something to
the second mate and returned to the cuddy.</p>

<p>&#8216;In foretopmast studdingsail!&#8217; bawled Mr.
Cocker; &#8216;clew up the mizzen-royal and furl
it.&#8217;</p>

<p>A little group of midshipmen hovering in
the dusk in the lee of the break of the poop,
where the shadow of the great mainsail lay
like the darkness of a thunderstorm upon the
air, rushed to the mizzen rigging, and in a few
moments the gossamer-like cloud floating
under the mizzen-royal truck was melting out
like a streak of vapour against the stars, with
a couple of the young lads making the shrouds
dance as they clawed their way up the ratlines.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s wrong with the weather, Mr.
Cocker,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that you are denuding the
ship in this fashion?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said he with a short laugh, &#8216;Captain
Keeling is a very cautious commander, sir.
He&#8217;ll never show a stun&#8217;sail to the night outside
the tropics; and it is a regular business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
with us to furl the fore and mizzen royal in
the second dog-watch, though it is so fine to-night,
he has let them fly longer than usual.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Humph!&#8217; said I; &#8216;no wonder he&#8217;s
popular with lady passengers. I suppose
there is no chance of the ship falling overboard
with the main-royal still on her?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When it comes to my getting command,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;the world will find that I am for
carrying on. What my ship can&#8217;t carry, she&#8217;ll
have to drag. I&#8217;ve made my calculations, and
there&#8217;s nothing with decent heels that shouldn&#8217;t
be able to make the voyage to India in seventy-five
days. It is the trick of wind-jamming that
stops us all. A skipper&#8217;ll sweat his yards fore
and aft sooner than be off his course by the
fraction of a point. For my part, I&#8217;d make
every foul wind a fair one.&#8217;</p>

<p>He called out some order to the group of
shadows at work upon the lower studdingsail,
and I went to the skylight with half a mind in
me to go below and see what was doing there;
but changed my intention when I saw friend
Colledge leaning over a draught-board with
Miss Temple, Miss Hudson looking on at the
game from the opposite side, and Mr. Johnson
drawing diagrams with his forefinger to Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Hudson in explanation of something I suppose
that he was talking about.</p>

<p>I went right aft and sat myself upon a little
bit of grating abaft the wheel, and there, spite
of the adjacency of the man at the helm, I felt
as much alone as if I had mastheaded myself.
The great body of the Indiaman went away
from me in a dark heap; the white deck of
the poop was a mere faintness betwixt the
rails. Her canvas rose in phantasmal ashen
outlines, with a slow swing of stars betwixt
the squares of the rigging, and a frequent
flashing of meteors on high sailing amongst
the luminaries in streaks of glittering dust.
There was little more to be heard than the
chafe of the tiller gear in its leading blocks,
the occasional dim noise of a rope straining to
the quiet lift of the Indiaman, the bubbling
of water going away in holes and eddies
from the huge rudder, and a dull tinkling of
the piano in the saloon, and some lady singing
to it.</p>

<p>All at once I spied the figure of a man
dancing down the main shrouds in red-hot
haste. I was going in a lounging way forward
at the moment, and heard Mr. Cocker say:
&#8216;What the deuce is it?&#8217; The fellow standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
on a ratline a little above the bulwark rail
made some answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are mad,&#8217; cried the mate. &#8216;What
<i>are</i> you&mdash;an Irishman?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir.&#8217; I had now drawn close enough
to catch what was said. &#8216;If I was, maybe I&#8217;d
be a Papish, and then the sign of the cross
would exercise [exorcise, I presume] the
blooming voice overboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Voice in your eye!&#8217; cried Mr. Cocker.
&#8216;Up again with you! This is some new dodge
for skulking. But you&#8217;ll have to invent
something better than a ghost before you
knock off on any job you&#8217;re upon aboard this
ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it, sir?&#8217; called the voice of the
captain from the companion, and he came
marching up to us in his buttoned-up way, as
though he sought to neutralise the trick of a
deep sea roll by a soldierly posture.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, sir,&#8217; answered Mr. Cocker, &#8216;this
man here has come down from aloft with a
run to tell me that there&#8217;s a ghost talking to
him upon the topsail yard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A what?&#8217; cried the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;I &#8217;splained it to the second officer as a
woice, sir,&#8217; said the man, speaking very respectfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
but emphatically, as one talking out of
a conviction.</p>

<p>&#8216;What did this voice say?&#8217; said the
captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;I was mounting the topmast rigging,&#8217; replied
the man, &#8216;and my head was on a level
with the tawps&#8217;l yard, when a woice broke
into a sort of raw &#8220;haw-haw,&#8221; and says,
&#8220;What d&#8217;ye want?&#8221; it says. &#8220;Hook it!&#8221; it
says. &#8220;I know you.&#8221; So down I come.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Anybody skylarking up there, Mr.
Cocker?&#8217;</p>

<p>The mate looked up with his hand to the
side of his mouth. &#8216;Aloft there!&#8217; he bawled;
&#8216;anybody on the topsail yard?&#8217;</p>

<p>We all strained our ears, staring intently,
but no response came, and there was nothing
to be seen. Dark as the shadow of the night
was up in the loom of the squares of canvas,
it was not so black but that a human figure
might have been seen up in it after some
searching with the gaze.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s your imagination, my man,&#8217; said the
captain, half-turning as though to walk aft.</p>

<p>&#8216;Up aloft with you again, now!&#8217; exclaimed
the second-mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;By thunder, then,&#8217; cried the man, smiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the ratline with his fist, whilst he clipped hold
of it with the other, swinging out and staring
up, &#8216;I&#8217;d rather go into irons for the rest of
the woyage!&#8217;</p>

<p>By this time a number of the watch on
deck had gathered about the main-hatchway,
and stood in a huddle in the obscurity, listening
to what was going forward. On a sudden a
fellow leapt out of the group and sprang into
the main rigging.</p>

<p>He hove some curses under his breath at
the seaman, who continued to hang in the
shrouds, and went aloft, hand over fist, as good
as disappearing to the eye as he climbed into
the big main top. The other man put his foot
on to the rail and dropped on to the deck,
where some of the sailors began eagerly in
hoarse hurried whispers to question him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, what d&#8217;ye see?&#8217; shouted Mr. Cocker,
sending his voice fair into the full heart of the
high glooming topsail.</p>

<p>There was no answer; but a few seconds
later I spied the dark form of the man swing off
the rigging on to the topmast backstay, down
which he slided in headlong speed. He
jumped on to the poop ladder and roared out:
&#8216;By holy Moses, then, sir, it&#8217;s the devil himself!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
There&#8217;s no man to be seen, and yet a
man there is!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And what did he say?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; he cried, wiping the sweat off his
brow, &#8216;Blast me, here he is again!&#8217;</p>

<p>The brief pause that followed showed the
captain as well as the second-mate, to be not a
little astonished. In fact, the fellow was one
of the boatswain&#8217;s mates, a bushy whiskered
giant of a sailor, assuredly not of a kind to
connive at any Jack&#8217;s horse-play or tomfoolery
in his watch on deck and under the eye of the
officer in charge. The captain sent one of the
midshipmen for his binocular glass, the second
mate meanwhile staggering back a few paces
to stare aloft. But there was no magic in the
skipper&#8217;s lenses to resolve the conundrum. Indeed,
I reckoned my own eyes to be as good
as any glasses for such an inspection as that;
but view the swelling heights as I would, going
from one part of the deck to another, that no
fathom of the length of the yards should escape
me, I could witness nothing resembling a
human shape, nothing whatever with the least
stir of life in it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, this beats my time!&#8217; said Mr. Cocker,
drawing a deep breath.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>&#8216;What sort of voice was it?&#8217; demanded
Captain Keeling, letting fall the binocular with
which he had been sweeping the fabric of spar
and sail, and coming to the brass rail overlooking
the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>The first of the two men who had been
terrified cried out from the group near the
hatchway, before the other could answer: &#8216;It
was exactly like the voice of Punch, sir, in
the Judy show.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then there <i>must</i> be a pair of &#8217;em!&#8217; roared
the other fellow with great excitement. &#8216;What
I heard was like a drunken old man swearing
in his sleep.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain,&#8217; said I, stepping forward, &#8216;let
me go aloft, will you? I&#8217;ve long wanted to
believe in ghosts, and here is a chance now for
me to embark in that faith.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ghosts, Mr. Dugdale? Yet it is an extraordinary
business too. There has been nothing
to hear from the deck, has there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing, sir,&#8217; answered Mr. Cocker. &#8216;But,
Mr. Dugdale, if you will take the weather
rigging, I&#8217;ll slip up to leeward; and it&#8217;ll be
strange if between us we don&#8217;t let the life out
of the wonder, be it what it will.&#8217;</p>

<p>I jumped at once into the weather shrouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
and was promptly travelling aloft with the
sight of the figure of the second mate in the
rigging abreast clawing the ratlines, and the
frog-like spread of his legs showing out against
the faintness of the space of the mainsail behind
him. We came together in the maintop, and
there stood looking up and listening a minute.</p>

<p>&#8216;I see nothing,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nor I,&#8217; said the second mate.</p>

<p>We peered carefully round us, then got into
the topmast rigging and climbed to the level
of the topsail yard, where we waited for the
wonderful voice to address us; but nothing
spoke, nor was there anything to be seen.</p>

<p>&#8216;Those two sailors must have fallen crazy,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s no need to go any higher,&#8217; said Mr.
Cocker; &#8216;the topgallant and royal yards lie
clear as rules against the stars. On deck
there!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hallo?&#8217; came the voice of the captain,
floating up in a sort of echo from the hull of
the ship, that looked a mile down in that
gloom.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s nothing up here for a voice to come
out of, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then you had better come down, sir,&#8217; called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the captain; and I thought I could hear a
little note of laughter below, as though two or
three passengers had collected.</p>

<p>Mr. Cocker&#8217;s vague form melted over the
top; but I lingered a minute to survey the
picture. My head was close against the maintopmast
cross-trees, a height of some eighty or
ninety feet above the line of the ship&#8217;s rail,
with the distance of the vessel&#8217;s side from the
water&#8217;s edge to add on to it. I lingered but a
minute or two, yet in that brief space the
shadowy night-scene, with the grand cathedral-like
figure of the noble craft sailing along in
the heart of it, was swept into me with such
vehemence of impression that the scene lies
upon my memory clear now as it then was in
that far-off, that very far-off, time. Every
sound on deck rose with a subdued thin tone, as
though from some elfin world. There was a
delicate throbbing of green fire in the black
water as it washed slowly past the lazy sides
of the <i>Countess Ida</i>, and upon this visionary,
faintly-glittering surface the form of the great
ship was shadowily depictured, with the glimmer
of the deck of the poop dimly dashed
with the illuminated squares of the skylights,
and a point of scarce determinable radiance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
confronting the wheel where the binnacle light
was showing. The ocean night-breeze sighed
with a note of surf heard from afar in the
quiet hollows of the canvas. There was sometimes
a little light pattering of the reef-points,
resembling the noise of the falling of a brief
summer thunder-shower upon fallen leaves.
The sea spread as vast as the sky, and you
seemed to be able to pierce to the other side
of the world, so infinitely distant did the
stars close to the horizon look, as though
<i>there</i> they were shining over an antipodean
land.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aloft there, Mr. Dugdale!&#8217; came dimly
sounding from the deck; &#8216;do you hear anything
more of the voice?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; I answered; but the cry had broken
the spell that was upon me, and down
I went, looking narrowly about me as I
descended.</p>

<p>I had scarcely gained the poop when there
was a commotion on the quarter-deck, and I
heard the voice of the Chinaman exclaiming:
&#8216;What sailor-man hab seen Prince? What
sailor-man, I say, hab seen him? Him gone
for lost, I say? Oh&mdash;ai&mdash;O; Oh&mdash;ai&mdash;O!
Him gone for lost, I say?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>&#8216;Who in thunder is making that row?&#8217;
shouted Mr. Cocker, putting his head over the
brass rail.</p>

<p>The Chinaman stepped out from under the
recess, and the cabin lights showed him up
plainly enough. He wrung his hands and
executed a variety of piteous gestures whilst he
cried: &#8216;Oh sah, did you sabbe Prince? Him
gone for lost, I say! Oh&mdash;ai&mdash;O! Oh&mdash;ai&mdash;O!
Him gone for lost, I say!&#8217; And here
he rolled his eyes up aloft and over the
bulwarks, and then made as if he would
rush forwards.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that you, Handcock?&#8217; said Mr. Cocker,
addressing a stout man who stepped out of the
cuddy at that moment.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir,&#8217; answered the fellow, who was
indeed the head steward.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter with that Chinese
idiot?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, sir, his mistress&#8217;s parrot has escaped.
He is responsible for the safe-keeping of the
fowl, and he&#8217;s just missed him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then it&#8217;ll ha&#8217; been that bloomin&#8217; parrot
that&#8217;s been a talking aloft,&#8217; said a deep voice
from near the pumps; but I noticed an uneasy
shifting amongst some of the figures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
standing there, as though <i>that</i> were a conjecture
not to be too hastily received.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here, John,&#8217; shouted Mr. Cocker; &#8216;come
up here, Johnny.&#8217;</p>

<p>The Chinaman, who continued to mutter
&#8216;Oh-ai-O!&#8217; whilst he gazed idiotically
about him with much wringing of his hands,
slowly and in attitudes of extreme misery,
ascended the poop ladder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Could this parrot talk, John?&#8217; said Mr.
Cocker.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, him talkee lubberly. Him speakee
like soul of Christian gen&#8217;man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What could he say?&#8217; shouted the second
mate, evidently desirous that this conversation
should be heard on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, him say &#8220;you go dam,&#8221;&#8217; cried John.</p>

<p>&#8216;And what else?&#8217; cried Mr. Cocker,
smothering his laughter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, him say &#8220;Gib me egg for breakfiss;&#8221;
and him laugh &#8220;haw-haw;&#8221; and him say
&#8220;hook it&#8221; and &#8220;whach you wantee;&#8221; and he
speakee better than common sailor-man;&#8217; and
here he burst out into another long wailing
&#8216;Oh&mdash;ai&mdash;O! Him gone for drownded.
Him gone for lost, I say!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now you hear what this man says, my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
lads,&#8217; called Mr. Cocker. &#8216;Jump aloft, those
of you who are not <i>afraid</i>, and catch the
bird if you can.&#8217;</p>

<p>The young fourth mate set the example;
and in a trice a dozen sailors were running
up the fore main and mizzen, where for a
long half-hour they were bawling to one
another, some of them feigning to have
caught the bird, whilst they <i>kurikity-cooed</i> at
the top of their pipes, the Chinaman meanwhile
shrieking with excitement as he ran
from one mast to another. But it was all to
no purpose. The bird had evidently gone
overboard; probably had attempted a flight
with its shorn pinions after the second of the
men who had been frightened had come down
in a hurry. The search was renewed next
morning at daybreak; but poor Prince was
gone for good.</p>

<small>WE LOSE A MAN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Spite</span> of Mr. Cocker&#8217;s hints as to Captain
Keeling&#8217;s timidity in the matter of canvas, the
old skipper evidently knew what he was about
in taking in his flying kites in good time, for
whilst the seamen were still scrambling in the
rigging and skylarking up there in search of
the parrot, the breeze freshened in a long
moaning gust over the rail, with a brighter
flashing of the stars to windward, and a
sudden stoop of the Indiaman that sent a
line of water washing along her sides in milk;
and at midnight she was bowing down with
nothing showing above her main topgallant-sail
to a strong wind off the beam, the stars
gone, and a look of hard weather in the obscurity
of the horizon.</p>

<p>For the next four days we had plenty of
wind and high seas with frequent grey rain-squalls
shrouding the ship, and leaving her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
with streaming decks and darkened canvas
and dribbling gear. It was Channel weather
again, in short, saving that there was the
relish of the temperate parallels in the air,
whilst the seas rolled large and wide and
regular with all the difference betwixt the
motion of the ship and her rollicking neck-breaking
capers in the narrow waters that
you&#8217;d find between the trot of a donkey and
the majestical thunderous gallop of a charger.</p>

<p>But the wet made a miserable time of it.
What was there to be seen on deck save the
gleaming forms of men in oil-skins, the sweep
of the dark-green surge out of the near veil
of haze, the rain-shadowed curves of the
canvas&mdash;the whole fitly put to music by the
damp dull clattering of booms, noises of
chafing up aloft, and the wild whistling of the
wind upon the taut weather rigging? The
males amongst us who smoked would come
together after meals in a huddle under the
break of the poop, cowering against the
weather bulkhead out of the wet of the rain;
and on these occasions arguments ran high.
If Colonel Bannister was of our company,
nothing could be said but that he whipped
out with a flat contradiction to it. In fact, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
was of that order of mind who reckons its
mission to be that of teaching everybody to
think correctly.</p>

<p>Once he endeavoured to prove to Mr.
Emmett that he was wanting in an essential
qualification of a painter, namely, an eye for
atmosphere, by requesting him to say how far
the horizon was off, and roaring in triumph
because Mr. Emmett answered five miles. Mr.
Johnson, after a careful look at the sea, submitted
that Mr. Emmett was right. The
colonel, pulling out his white whiskers, asked
how it was possible that a journalist should
know anything about such things. Angry
words were averted by Mynheer Hemskirk,
who, with a fat face and foolish smile, broke
in with a mouldy old puzzle: &#8216;Answer me
dis: here iss a bortrait. I shtands opposite,
und I shay, &#8220;Brooders und shisters hov I
none boot dot man&#8217;s farder iss my farder&#8217;s
soon! Vot relation iss dot man to dot
bicture?&#8221;&#8217; The colonel had never heard
this, and asked the Dutchman to repeat it.
Mr. Hodder in a mild voice said: &#8216;It is himself.&#8217;
Little Mr. Saunders, after thinking hard,
said it was his father. &#8216;<i>That&#8217;s</i> it, of course!&#8217;
shouted the colonel. The Dutchman said no,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
and repeated the lines with great emphasis,
striking one fist into the palm of the other at
every syllable. Then sides were taken merely
to enrage the colonel. Some agreed with him,
and some with the Dutchman. Mr. Emmett,
feigning not to catch the point, compelled the
stupid good-natured Hemskirk to repeat the
question a dozen times over. So loud was the
argument, so angry the colonel, so excited the
Dutchman, and so demonstrative most of the
others of the listeners, that the chief officer
came off the poop to look at us.</p>

<p>I give this as an instance of our method
of killing that dreary time. The old ladies
for the most part kept their cabins; but the
girls came into the cuddy as usual, and made
the interior comfortable to the eye as they sat
here and there with knitting-needles in their
hands or a book upon their knees.</p>

<p>On one of these foul-weather afternoons,
hearing a strange noise of singing, I entered
the cuddy, and found Peter Hemskirk standing
with his face to the company and his back
upon one of the Miss Joliffes, who was accompanying
him at the piano. He was singing a
fashionable sentimental song of that day, &#8216;I&#8217;d
be a Butterfly, born in a Bower.&#8217; The posture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of the man was exquisitely absurd as he stood
with his immensely fat figure swaying to the
movements of the ship, a ridiculous smile
upon his face, whilst he held his arms extended,
singing first to one and then to another, so
that every one might share in the song. The
picture of this great corpulent man, with an
overflow of chins between his shirt collars,
and a vast surface of green waistcoat arching
out like the round of a full topsail, and then
curving in again to a pair of legs of the exact
resemblance of a pegtop&mdash;standing as he was
with his feet close together&mdash;I say, the sight
of this immense man singing &#8216;I&#8217;d be a Booterfly&#8217;
in falsetto, proved too much for the
company. They listened a little with sober
faces; but at last Miss Hudson gave way, and
bent her head behind her mother and lay
shaking in an hysterical fit of laughter; then
another girl laughed out; then followed a
general chorus of merriment. But the undaunted
Dutchman persevered. He would
not let us off a single syllable, but worked his
way without the least alteration of posture
right through the song, making us a low bow
when he had come to an end; whilst Miss
Joliffe, darting from the piano stool, fled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
through the saloon and disappeared down the
hatchway with a face as red as a powder-flag.</p>

<p>Miss Temple was the only one of us unmoved
by this ridiculous exhibition. She
kept her eyes bent on a book in her lap for
the most part whilst Mynheer sang, now and
then glancing round her with a face of cold
wonder. Once our eyes met, when she instantly
sent her gaze flashing to her book
again. Indeed, it was already possible to see
the sort of opinion in which she was held by
her fellow-passengers by their manner of
holding off from her as from a person who
considered herself much too good to be of
them, though the obligation of going to India
forced her to be with them. Yet one easily
guessed that the other girls hugely admired
her. I&#8217;d notice them running their eyes over
her dress, watching her face and bearing at
table, following her motions about the deck;
and again and again I would overhear them
speaking in careful whispers about her when
she was out of sight. In short, she might
have been a woman of distinguished title
amongst us; and if the passengers gave her a
respectful berth, it was certainly not, I think,
because they would not have felt themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
flattered by an unbending or friendly behaviour
in her.</p>

<p>On the following Thursday the wind
slackened, the weather cleared, and midway
of the forenoon it was already a hot sparkling
morning, with a high heaven of delicate
clouds like a silver frosting of the blue vault,
a wide sea of flowing sapphire, and the
Indiaman swaying along under studdingsails
to the royal yards. I had been spending an
hour in my bunk reading. As I passed
through the cuddy on my way to the poop I
heard the report of firearms, and on going on
deck found Mr. Colledge and Miss Temple
shooting with pistols at a bottle that dangled
from the lee main-yard-arm. Most of the
passengers sat about watching them; but the
couple were alone in the pastime. The pistols
were very elegant weapons, mounted in silver,
with long gleaming barrels. Colledge loaded
and handed them to his companion, occasionally
taking aim himself.</p>

<p>She could not have lighted upon any
practice fitter to exhibit and accentuate the
perfections of her figure and face. Her dark
glance went sparkling along the line of the
levelled barrel; her lips, of a delicate red,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
lay lightly apart to the sweep of the breeze,
that was sweet and warm as new milk; her
colourless face under the broad shadow of her
hat resembled some faultless carving in marble
magically informed by a sort of dumb
haughty human vitality. I cannot tell you
how she was attired, but her figure was there
in its lovely proportions, a full yet maidenly
delicate shape against the clear azure over
the sea-line, as she stood poised on small firm
feet upon the leaning and yielding deck, her
head thrown back, her arm extended, and a
fire in her deep liquid eyes that anticipated
the flash of the pistol.</p>

<p>&#8216;A very noble-looking woman, sir,&#8217; said a
voice low down at my side.</p>

<p>Mr. Richard Saunders stood gazing up at
me with the eager wistful expression that is
somewhat common in dwarfs. It was on the
tip of my tongue to ask the poor little chap if
he had ever been in love; but he was a man
whose sensitiveness and tenderness of heart
obliged one to think twice before speaking.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, Mr. Saunders. A noble woman
indeed, as you say,&#8217; I answered as softly as he
had spoken. &#8216;But how pale is her cheek!
It makes you think of the white death that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
Helena speaks of in &#8220;All&#8217;s Well that Ends
Well.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What Hemmeridge would term chlorosis,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;No, sir; she is perfectly healthy.
It is a very uncommon complexion indeed,
and very fit for a throne or some high place
from which a woman needs to gaze imperiously
and with a countenance that must not
change colour.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She looks to have been born to something
higher than she is likely to attain,&#8217; said
I, watching her with eyes I found it impossible
to withdraw. &#8216;A pity there did not go
a little more womanhood to her composition.
She might make a fine actress, and do very
well in the unrealities of life; but I should
say there is but small heart there, Mr.
Saunders, with just the same amount of pride
that sent Lucifer flaming headlong to&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>Some one coughed immediately behind
me. I looked round and met Mrs. Radcliffe&#8217;s
gaze full. She was seated on a hencoop; but
whether she was there when I came to a
stand to view Miss Temple, or had arrived
unobserved by me, I could not tell. I felt the
blood rise in scarlet to my brow, and walked
right away forward on the forecastle, greatly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
I doubt not, to the astonishment of little
Saunders, who, I believe, was in the act of
addressing me when I bolted.</p>

<p>I went into the head of the ship and leaned
against the slope of the giant bowsprit as it
came in the towering steeve of those days, to
the topgallant-forecastle deck, through which
it vanished like the lopped trunk of a titan
oak whose roots go deep. The ping of a
pistol report caught my ear. There was a
sound of the splintering of glass at the yard-arm,
along with some hand-clapping on the
poop, as though the passengers regarded this
shooting at a mark as an entertainment designed
for their amusement. Far out ahead
of me, jockeying the jib-boom, sat a sailor at
work on the stay there; his figure stooped
and soared with the lift of the long spar that
pointed like the ship&#8217;s outstretched finger to
the shining azure distance into which she was
sailing, and he sang a song to himself in
hoarse low notes, that to my mind put a
better music to the flowing satin-like heavings
of the darkly blue water under him than any
mortal musician that I can think of could
have married the picture to. There were a
few seamen occupied on various jobs about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
the forecastle. The square of the hatch
called the scuttle, lay dark in the deck, and
rising up through it, I could hear the grumbling
notes of a sailor apparently reading aloud
to one of his mates.</p>

<p>Presently the bewhiskered face of the boatswain
showed at the head of the forecastle
ladder. On spying me, he approached with
the rough sea-salute of a drag at a lock of
hair under his round hat. He had served
as able seaman aboard the ship that I
had been midshipman in, though before my
time; this had come out in a chat, and now
he had always a friendly greeting when I met
him on deck. He was a sailor of a school
that is almost extinct; a round-backed man
of the merchantman&#8217;s slowness in his movements,
yet probably as fine a sample of a
boatswain as was ever afloat; with an eye
that seemed to compass the whole ship in a
breath, of a singular capacity of seeing into a
man and knowing what he was fit for, most
exquisitely and intimately acquainted with
the machinery of a vessel; a delightful performer
upon his silver pipe, out of which he
coaxed such clear and penetrating strains
that you would have imagined when he blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
upon it a flight of canary birds had settled in
the rigging round about him. The voice of the
tempest was in his gruff cry of &#8216;All hands!&#8217;
and his face might have stood as a symbol for
hard ocean weather, as the bursting cheeks of
Boreas express the north wind. He carried a
little length of tough but pliant cane in his
hand, with which he would flog whatever
stood next him when excited and finding
fault with some fellow for &#8216;sogering,&#8217; as it is
called; and I once saw him catch a man of
his own size by the scruff of the neck, and
with his cane dust the hinder part of him as
prettily as ever a schoolmaster laid it on to a
boy.</p>

<p>&#8216;At the wrong end of the ship, ain&#8217;t you,
sir?&#8217; he called to me as he approached in his
strong hearty voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s all one to me,&#8217; said I, laughing, &#8216;now
that there&#8217;s no music in the like of that pipe
of yours to set me dancing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; he exclaimed, fetching a deep
breath. &#8216;I wonder if ever it&#8217;ll be my luck
to knock off the sea and settle down ashore?
I allow there&#8217;s more going to the life of a
human being than the turning in of dead-eyes
and the staying of masts <i>plumb</i>. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the way,&#8217; added he, lowering his voice, &#8216;I&#8217;m
afeerd there&#8217;s going to be a death aboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope not,&#8217; said I; &#8216;it will be the first,
and a little early, too. Who&#8217;s the sick man,
bo&#8217;sun?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, a chap named Crabb,&#8217; he answered.
&#8216;I think you know him. I once took notice
of a smile on your countenance as you stood
watching him at the pumps.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What! do you mean that bow-legged
carroty creature with no top to his nose and
one eye trying to look astern?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; said he; &#8216;that&#8217;s Crabb.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dying, d&#8217;ye say, Mr. Smallridge?&#8217; I considered
an instant, and exclaimed: &#8216;Surely
he was at the wheel from ten to twelve during
the first watch last night?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So he was,&#8217; answered the boatswain;
&#8216;but he took ill in the middle watch, and the
latest noose is that he&#8217;s a-dying rapidly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the poor fellow&#8217;s malady?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, the doctor don&#8217;t seem rightly to
understand,&#8217; he answered: &#8216;he&#8217;s been forrards
twice since breakfast-time, and calls it a
general break-up&mdash;an easy tarm for the
&#8216;splaining of a difficulty. But what it means,
blowed if I know,&#8217; he added, with a glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
aft, to observe if the mate had hove into
sight.</p>

<p>&#8216;A general break-up,&#8217; said I, &#8216;signifies a
decay of the vital organs. I don&#8217;t mean to
say that Crabb isn&#8217;t decayed, but I certainly
should have thought the worst of his distemper
lay outside.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes,&#8217; said he; &#8216;you wouldn&#8217;t suppose
that he&#8217;d need a worse illness than his own
face to kill him. But this ain&#8217;t seeing after
the ship&#8217;s work, is it?&#8217; and with another
pleasant sea-flourish of his hand to his brow,
he left me.</p>

<p>A little later, I was walking leisurely aft,
meaning to regain the poop for a yarn with
Colledge, who stood alone to leeward, looking
over the rail with his arms folded in the
attitude of a man profoundly bored, when
the ship&#8217;s doctor, Mr. Hemmeridge, came out
of the cuddy door to take a few pulls at his
pipe under the shelter of the overhanging
deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;So, doctor,&#8217; said I, planting myself carelessly
in front of him with a light swing on
my straddled legs to the soft heave of the
ship, &#8216;we are to lose a man, I hear?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who told you that?&#8217; he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
gazing at me out of a pair of moist weak
eyes, which, I am afraid, told a story of
something even stronger than his jalap and
Glauber salts, stored secretly amongst the
bottles which filled the shelves of his dark
and dismal little berth right away aft over the
lazarette.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, the air is full of the news,&#8217; said I:
&#8216;a ship&#8217;s a village, where whatever happens
is known to all the neighbours.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know about losing a man,&#8217; said
he, striking a spark into a tinder-box and
lighting his pipe with a sulphur match; &#8216;he&#8217;s
not dead yet, anyway. We must keep our
voices hushed in these matters aboard ship,
Mr. Dugdale. Wherever there are ladies,
there&#8217;s a deal of nervousness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;True; and I&#8217;ll be as hushed as you
please. But this Crabb is so amazing a
figure, that I can&#8217;t but feel interested in his
illness. What ails him, now?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If he dies, it must be of decay,&#8217; he
answered, with a toss of his hand. &#8216;I can
find nothing wrong with him but the manner
of his going. He lies motionless, and groans
occasionally. It will be a matter in which
the heart is involved, no doubt.&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>I saw my curiosity did not please him,
and so, after exchanging a few idle sentences,
I mounted the poop and joined Mr. Colledge.</p>

<p>He was looking at the water that was
passing, but not greatly heeding the sight of
it. I daresay, though there was much, nevertheless,
to engage the eye of a lover of sea-bits
in the delicate interlacery of foam that came
past in spaces like veils of lace spreading out
on the heave of the sea along with cloudy
seethings of milk-white softness under the
surface, which made a wonder of the radiant
opalescent blue of the clear profound there
that was softened out of its sunny brilliance
by the shadowing of the high side of the
Indiaman.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is going to be a long voyage, I am
afraid,&#8217; exclaimed Colledge, with a sort of
sigh, bringing his back round upon the rail
and leaning against it with folded arms.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not bored already, I hope?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, do you know, Dugdale,&#8217; he exclaimed,
whilst I caught his eye following the
form of Miss Hudson, who was walking the
weather-deck with Mr. Emmett, &#8216;I believe
I made a mistake in engaging myself before
I started. When a man asks a girl to be his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wife, he ought to marry her with as little
delay as possible. Now, here am I leaving
the sweetheart I have affianced myself to for
perhaps ten months of ocean voyaging, with
some months on top of it in India for
shooting, and the chance beyond of being
eaten up by the game I pursue.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why did you engage yourself?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;I had been lunching at her father&#8217;s house&mdash;Sir
John Crawley, member for Oxborough,
a red-hot Tory, and one of the noblest hands
at billiards you could dream of. Do you
know him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Never heard of him,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, he rarely speaks in the House,
certainly. I had been lunching with him and
Fanny; and as I was not likely to see the old
chap again this side of my Indian trip, he
plied me with champagne in a loving way;
and when I walked with Fanny into the
garden for a little ramble, I was rather more
emotional than is customary with me; and
the long and short of it is I proposed to her,
and she accepted me. Here she is,&#8217; said he;
and he put his hand in his pocket and produced
a very delicate little ivory miniature of
a merry, pretty, rather Irish face, with soft<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
brown curls about the forehead, and a
roguish look in the slightly lifted regard of
the eyes, as though she were shooting a
glance at you through her upper lashes.</p>

<p>&#8216;A very sweet creature,&#8217; said I, giving him
back the painting. &#8216;Is not she good enough
for you? Bless my soul, what coxcombs men
are! What is there to fret you in knowing
that you have won the love of such a sweetheart
as that?&#8217;</p>

<p>He hung his handsome face over the
miniature, gazing at it with an intentness that
brought his eyes to a squint, then slipped it
into his pocket, exclaiming with an odd note
of contrition in his voice: &#8216;Well, I&#8217;m a doocid
ass, I suppose. But still I think I made a
mistake in engaging myself. There was time
enough to ask her to marry me when I returned.
Who knows that I shall ever
return?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, <i>don&#8217;t</i> be sentimental, my dear
fellow.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes, that&#8217;s all very fine,&#8217; said he;
&#8216;but I suppose you know that tiger-hunting
isn&#8217;t altogether like chasing a hare, for instance.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t tiger-hunt, then,&#8217; said I, growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
sick of all this. &#8216;Hark! what fine voice is
that singing in the cuddy?&#8217;</p>

<p>He pricked his ear. &#8216;Oh, it is Miss
Temple,&#8217; said he; and he stole away to the
after skylight, through which a glimpse of the
piano was to be had. He took a peep, then
bestowed a train of nods upon me, and a
moment after crept below. Alas! for Fanny
Crawley, thought I.</p>

<p>Both of the wide skylights were open, and
Miss Temple&#8217;s voice rose clear and full, a rich
contralto, with now and then a tremor sounding
through it in an added quality of sweetness.
Those who were walking paused to listen, and
those who were seated let fall their work or
lifted their eyes from their books. Mr. Johnson
and one or two others assembled at the
skylight. But no one saving friend Colledge
offered to go below. I could have bet a
thousand pounds that the cuddy was empty,
or the girl never would have sung. In fact,
one took notice of a sort of timidity in the
very hearkening of the people to her, as though
she were a princess whose voice was something
to be listened to afar and with respect, and
who was not to be approached or disturbed
on any account whatever. Soon after she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
ended, a male voice piped up, and Mr. Johnson,
after listening a little, came sauntering
over to me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your friend Colledge don&#8217;t sing ill,&#8217; he
exclaimed with the complacent grin he usually
put on before delivering himself. &#8216;Do you
feel equal to a small bet?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the wager to be about?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I bet you,&#8217; said he, closing one eye,
&#8216;twenty shillings to a crown that Mr. Colledge
and Miss Temple will have plighted their troth
before we strike the longitude of the Cape of
Good Hope.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why not latitude?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, my dear sir, don&#8217;t you see that the
longitude gives me a broader margin?&#8217; And
the fellow was actually beginning to explain
the difference between latitude and longitude,
when I cut him short.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll not bet,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I have no wish to
win your money on a certainty. They won&#8217;t
be engaged, and so you&#8217;d better keep your
sovereign.&#8217;</p>

<p>He whistled low, and with a melancholy
attempt at a comical cast of countenance, exclaimed:
&#8216;Ah, I see how it goes. It is the
wish, my friend, that&#8217;s father to the thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
But Lor&#8217; preserve us; my dear Mr. Dugdale,
do you suppose that a young lady after her
pattern would ever condescend to cast her eye
upon anything even the sixtieth part of one
single degree beneath the level of the son of
a baron and heir to the title and property?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you recollect,&#8217; said I, &#8216;how your
name-sake Dr. Samuel Johnson told his friends
that being teased by a neighbour at table to
give his opinion on Horace or Virgil, I forget
which, he immediately fixed his attention on
thoughts of Punch and Judy? Suffer me now
to imitate that great man and to think of
Punch and Judy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Here comes Punch, I do believe,&#8217; said he
with a good-natured laugh.</p>

<p>As he spoke, up rose the figure of Colonel
Bannister from the quarter-deck. His face
was red with temper, his eyes sparkled, and
his white whiskers stood out like spikes of
light from a flame. We happened to be the
first persons he came across as he climbed the
ladder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of all infernal instruments,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;the
piano is the worst. What on earth, I should
like to know, do shipowners mean by adding
that execrable piece of furniture to the cabin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
accommodation? The moment I sit down to
write up my diary, twang-twang goes that
scoundrel Jew&#8217;s harp; and as if that noise
were not enough, a woman must needs fall a-squealing
to it; and then, when I think that
the row is over for a bit, and I pick up my
pen afresh, some chap with a voice like a
tormented hog lets fly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You should write to the <i>Times</i>, sir,&#8217; said
Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p>The colonel gave him a look full of
marlinespikes and corkscrews, and walked aft
on his short stiff legs to the captain, with whom
I heard him expostulating in very strong
language. Presently the tiffin-bell rang, and
I went below.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>A SEA FUNERAL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> doctor sat on the starboard side of the
table, and I caught him eyeing me with a
meaning expression that somewhat puzzled me.
Once, indeed, he winked, and fearing that he
might be a little tipsy and easily led into
a demonstrativeness of manner sufficiently
marked to catch the skipper&#8217;s attention, I took
some pains not to see him. Old Keeling, at
the head of the table, his face shining like a
mahogany figure-head under a fresh coat of
varnish, was in the middle of the story of
his action with the corsair in the Bay of
Bengal, when Mr. Prance entered the cuddy
and quietly took his seat. He fell to work
upon a piece of corned beef whilst he seemed
to listen with a face of respectful courtesy to
Keeling&#8217;s long-winded yarn, with its running
commentary of &#8216;How brave!&#8217; &#8216;What dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
creatures!&#8217; &#8216;How very awful!&#8217; and the like
from the ladies.</p>

<p>The skipper came to an end, and Mr. Prance
said to me: &#8216;A plucky fight, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very,&#8217; said I, watching for that twinkle
of eye which his voice suggested.</p>

<p>&#8216;The best of an engagement of that sort,&#8217;
he exclaimed, &#8216;is that you may go on fighting
it over and over again without loss of blood.
By the way, talking of pirates, the captain
has yet to be informed that one of them lies
dead aboard his ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>I stared at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;A fellow named Crabb,&#8217; he began.</p>

<p>&#8216;What!&#8217; I interrupted; &#8216;is Crabb dead
then?&#8217;</p>

<p>It was now his turn to stare. &#8216;Do you
know the man, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, yes,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;as the ugliest
creature (heaven rest his soul, since he <i>is</i>
dead!) that ever encountered mortal gaze.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But how did you learn that his name was
Crabb, and that he was dying? for <i>that</i> you
seem to have guessed also, judging from your
question?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, my dear sir,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;you have
a large company of sailors on board, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
ship is full of deep-sea voices, and I carry ears
in my head, Mr. Prance.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Humph!&#8217; said he. &#8216;Well, as I&#8217;ve always
said, news travels a deal too fast aboard
passenger craft. In fact, I&#8217;ve known passengers
to pick up things which had remained for
weeks afterwards secrets to the captain and
mates.&#8217; He emptied a glass of marsala and
added: &#8216;You are right in speaking of the man&#8217;s
ugliness. I have been to see him as he lies
in his bunk.&#8217; He made a dreadful grimace
and upturned his eyes to the deck above.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was this Crabb a pirate?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;but I had not heard
of it down to half an hour ago. The carpenter
knew him, but held his tongue when he found
him a shipmate. Now that the fellow is dead,
Chips has a yarn as long as the sea-snake about
him. He did business in West Indian waters;
and the carpenter says that if the stories he
told against himself were to be believed, no
viler miscreant ever stepped between the rails
of a ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But did he brag of his evil doings in the
forecastle before the men?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;No; Chips had been shipmate with him
two voyages ago in a small craft, and he afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
met him ashore in several of the low
sailors&#8217; haunts down in the east end of London.
When he had too much drink, he would out
with the most blood-curdling tales of atrocity.
No, sir; he kept his counsel aboard this ship.
He knew what would have followed had his
career been suspected by us aft.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When do you bury him?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;To-morrow morning, I suppose,&#8217; he
answered. &#8216;Captain Keeling is averse to hasty
funerals. I&#8217;ve heard him say that when he
was chief mate, a man died, and two hours
later the body had been stitched up ready for
the last toss; but whilst the captain was looking
for his Prayer-book, the boatswain of the
ship came rushing aft with his hair on end
and his eyes half out of his head to report
that the hammock with its contents had rolled
off the grating on which it was placed, and
was wriggling about the deck. When it was
cut open, the fellow inside was found to be
alive, bathed in perspiration and half-mad with
fright.&#8217;</p>

<p>This conversation we had carried on in a
low voice, easily managed, as I sat on his right
hand close against him. A few minutes later
the mate went on to the poop, and I stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to the quarter-deck to smoke a cheroot. Whilst
I was preparing the weed to light it, Dr. Hemmeridge
came out of the cuddy.</p>

<p>&#8216;You may be interested to know,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;that your ugly friend is dead.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And that is what you wished to convey
to me by winking?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He nodded with a smile that could scarcely
be called sober. &#8216;You took a particular interest
in him,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;and so I thought I
would give you the news before I made my
report to the captain.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You are very good,&#8217; I exclaimed with a
sarcastic bow.</p>

<p>&#8216;In fact, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;I am
going to pay another visit to the forecastle, as
there is something in the manner of this fellow&#8217;s
death that puzzles me. Indeed, it is as likely
as not I may make a post-mortem examination.&#8217;
Here he lifted his hand and eyed it an instant.
I noticed that it trembled. He immediately
grew conscious of his action, blushed slightly,
and spoke with a note of confusion: &#8216;The devil
of it is, the Jacks object to this sort of inquisitions.
Then, again, the light forward is
abominably bad, and there is too much risk
when there are ladies aboard in any attempt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
to smuggle the body aft. Would you like to
see the man? You admired him in life, you
know.&#8217;</p>

<p>I hung in the wind a moment, then said:
&#8216;Yes; I will go with you;&#8217; and we trudged
forwards.</p>

<p>The sailors&#8217; dwelling-place was what is
called a topgallant forecastle; a structure in
the bows of the ship corresponding with the
cuddy and its poop-deck aft. There was a
wing on either hand of it that came very nearly
to abreast of the foremast, for in those times a
ship&#8217;s foremast was stepped or erected nearer
to the bows than it now stands. Each of these
two wings held a couple of cabins, respectively
occupied by the boatswain, the sailmaker, the
carpenter, and the cook. You entered the
forecastle itself by doors just forward of the
huge windlass, the great fore-hatch lying between
it and the long-boat that stood in
chocks full of live-stock. It should have been
familiar ground to me; yet I found something
of real novelty, too, in the sight as I
followed the doctor through the port door and
entered what resembled a vast gloomy cave,
resonant with the sound of seas smitten by the
cutwater, with a slush-lamp swinging amidships<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
under a begrimed beam, and a line of daylight
falling a little beyond fair through the open
scuttle or deck-hatch, and resembling in its
dusty shaft and defined margin a sunbeam
striking through a chink of the shutter of a
darkened room.</p>

<p>There was at least a score of hammocks
hung up under the ceiling or upper deck,
with here and there the faces of mariners
showing over them, or perhaps the half of a
stockinged leg, and nothing else of the man
inside but <i>that</i> to be seen. There was also a
double tier of bunks, which wound round
from the after bulkhead into the gloom forward,
that seemed the darker, somehow, for
the loom of the immense heel of the bowsprit
that came piercing through the knightheads.
It was a rough, wild scene to survey by that
light; a blending into a sort of muddle,
as it were, of hammocks and sea-chests and
stanchions and dangling oil-skins and sea-boots
and canvas bags, and divers other odds
and ends of the marine equipment. There
were figures seated on the boxes, stolidly
smoking, or stitching at their clothes; grim,
silent, unshaven salts, stealing out upon the
eye in that strange commingling of dull light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
and dim shadow, in proportions so grotesque
and even startling that they hardly needed to
vanish on a sudden to persuade one they
were creatures of another universe. Many
creaking and straining noises threaded the
hush in this gloomy timber cavern. The
motion of the ship, too, was much more
defined here than it was aft, and you felt the
deck rising and falling under your feet as
though you were on a see-saw with a frequent
small thunder of cleft sea breaking in.</p>

<p>The doctor made his way to a bunk on
the port side, almost abreast of the scuttle,
where the light came sifting through the
gloom with power enough to define shape,
and even colour. In this bunk lay a motionless
figure under a blanket, and a small
square of canvas over his head. The bunks
in the immediate neighbourhood were empty,
and the fellows who swung in hammocks a
little distance away peered dumbly at us, with
eyes which gleamed like discs of polished
steel amid the hair on their faces.</p>

<p>Dr. Hemmeridge pulled the bit of sail-cloth
from the face of the body, and there
lay before me the most hideous mask that
could enter the mind of any man, saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the master who drew Caliban, to figure.
Nothing showed of the eyes through the contracted
lids but the whites. There was a
drop in the under-jaw that had twisted the
creature&#8217;s hare-lip into the distortion of a
shocking grin.</p>

<p>I took one look and recoiled, and, as I
did so, a fellow who had been watching us
at the forecastle door approached and said
respectfully: &#8216;There ain&#8217;t no doubt of his
being stone-dead, sir, I suppose?&#8217;</p>

<p>Hemmeridge turned from the body. There
was an odd look of loathing and puzzlement
in his face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh yes, man, quite dead,&#8217; he answered.
&#8216;An amazing corpse, don&#8217;t you think, Mr. Dugdale?
Good enough to preserve in spirits
as a show for the museum of a hospital.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope,&#8217; exclaimed a deep voice from a
hammock that swung near, &#8216;if so be that that
there Crabb&#8217;s dead and gone, he ain&#8217;t going
to be let lie to p&#8217;ison the parfumed hatmosphere
of this here drawing-room.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, my man,&#8217; answered the doctor, looking
at the body; &#8216;we&#8217;ll have him out of this
in good time. But there&#8217;s nothing to hurt in
his remaining here a bit.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>&#8216;What did he doy of?&#8217; asked an old
sailor, who had risen from his chest, and
stood surveying us as he leaned against a
stanchion with the inverted bowl of a sooty
pipe betwixt his teeth.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, what would be the good,&#8217; cried the
doctor fretfully, &#8216;of giving this forecastle a
lecture on the causes of death? What did
he die of? A plague on&#8217;t, Mr. Dugdale! Do
you know I&#8217;ve a great mind to take a peep
inside him, if only in the interests of the
medical journals.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m beginning to feel a little faint,&#8217; said
I, with a movement towards the forecastle
door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh well, Mr. Willard,&#8217; exclaimed Hemmeridge,
addressing the man who had approached
us, and who proved to be the sailmaker,
&#8216;have him stitched up as soon as you
please, and then get him on to the fore-hatch
with a tarpaulin over him, till other orders
come forward.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are ye likely to hold an inquest, doctor?&#8217;
asked the sailmaker, whose Roman
nose and thin frill or streamlet of wool-white
whisker running under his chin from one ear
to another gave him a queer sort of yearning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
<i>raised</i> haggard look in that light, as he inclined
his head forward to ask the question.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, it wouldn&#8217;t be an inquest,&#8217; responded
the doctor with a short laugh. &#8216;But it is
death from natural causes, anyway,&#8217; added he
in a careless voice; &#8216;and so we&#8217;ll go aft again,
Mr. Dugdale; unless, indeed, you would like
to take another view of your friend?&#8217;</p>

<p>I shoved past him, and got out of the
forecastle at once; and never before did the
sunshine seem more glorious, nor the ocean
breeze sweeter, nor the swelling heights of
the Indiaman more airily beautiful and majestic.
In fact, I had felt half suffocated in that
forecastle; and as I made my way to the
poop, I respired the gushing wind as it
hummed past me over the bulwarks as
thirstily as ever shipwrecked sailor lapped
water.</p>

<p>That same evening, some time after dinner,
after a long smoke and a yarn with
Colledge and young Fairthorne down on the
quarter-deck, where we patrolled the planks
in a regular look-out swing from the cuddy
front to the gangway and back again, I went
on to the poop, leaving my two companions
to continue a game of chess in the cuddy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
where they had been playing that afternoon.
It was a fine clear moonless night, with a
pleasant breeze out of the north-east, before
which the ship was quietly running under
all plain sail, saving the fore and mizzen
royals, with a foretopmast studdingsail boom
still rigged out and reeling gaunt athwart the
stars to the quiet heave and plunge of the
ship, as though it were some giant fishing-rod
in the hand of a Colossus bobbing for
whales.</p>

<p>There were a few passengers moving about
the deck, but it was too dark to make sure of
them, though the delicate sheen in the air,
falling in a sort of silver showering from the
velvet-dark heaven of brilliants on high,
enabled one to see forms and to follow the
movements of things clearly. There was a
deal of phosphorus in the water this night,
and I stood looking over the lee quarter at
the pale green or sun-coloured flashings of it
as it swept into the race of our wake in fiery
coils, in configurations as of writhing serpents,
in fibrine interwreathings that would enlarge
and shape themselves into the proportions of
sea-monsters and leviathan fish.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it true, do you know, that one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
sailors died this afternoon?&#8217; exclaimed a low,
clear, but most melodious voice by my side.</p>

<p>It was Miss Temple. She started as I
quitted my leaning posture and turned to
her.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I beg your pardon,&#8217; she exclaimed in
a changed note.</p>

<p>It was very clear she had mistaken me&mdash;for
Colledge, for all I can tell. She was alone.
Yet had she come from the cuddy, she must
certainly have seen the young sprig playing at
the table with Fairthorne at chess.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should be glad to answer your question,&#8217;
said I coolly, &#8216;if you care to stop and listen,
Miss Temple.&#8217;</p>

<p>By the starlight I could see her fine imperious
dark eyes bent on me.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is curious,&#8217; she exclaimed&mdash;and perhaps
by daylight I should have found some sign of
a smile in her face; but her countenance
showed like marble in that shadow&mdash;&#8216;that
this should be the second time I have asked you
about what is happening in the ship. You
have been a sailor, I think, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Colledge has doubtless told you so,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; it was he who told me. You share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
his cabin, I believe. Will you tell me if it
be true that one of the sailors has died?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is true,&#8217; said I; &#8216;a sailor named Crabb
died this morning.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Has he been buried?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No; that ceremony is to take place in
the morning, I believe.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Our ship, then, will sail all night long
with a dead body on board?&#8217; she exclaimed
with a lift of her eyes to the stars and then a
look seawards. &#8216;Are not the superstitions of
sailors opposed to such burdens?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Jack does not love dead bodies,&#8217; said I,
making as if to resume my leaning posture at
the rail, as one interrupted in a reverie; for
harmless as her questions were, I did not at all
relish her haughty commanding manner of
putting them; besides, this was the first time
I had exchanged a sentence with her since
that night of the collision in the Channel; and
the unconquerable delight I took in gazing at
her beauty, that <i>now</i>, to my ardent young
eyes, was idealised by the starlit dusk by
which I surveyed her into graces beyond
expression fascinating, affected me also as a
sort of injury to my own dignity, thanks to
the mood that had grown up in me through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
what I had said and thought of her. &#8216;But,&#8217;
continued I carelessly, &#8216;what is regarded as a
superstition by the sailor is a stroke of nature
common to us all. One may travel far without
meeting any person who will choose a
dead body for company.&#8217;</p>

<p>She walked to the rail a few feet away
from where I stood, and looked at the water
for some while in silence, as though she had
not heard me.</p>

<p>&#8216;I would rather die anywhere than at sea,&#8217;
she exclaimed, as though thinking aloud, with
a sudden crossing of her hands upon her
breast, as if a chill had entered her from the
dark ocean. &#8216;The horror of being buried in
that void there would keep me alive. Oh, if
it be true, as Shakespeare says, that dreams
may visit us in our graves&mdash;in our graves
ashore, where there are daisies and green turf
and the twinkling shadows of leaves, and often
the full moon and the high summer night
shedding a peace like that of God himself,
passing all understanding, upon the dead&mdash;<i>what</i>
should be the visions that enter into the
sleep of one floating deep down in that great
mystery there?&#8217;</p>

<p>This was a passage of humour which I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
was quite young enough to have coaxed, and
have sought to improve in any other fine
young woman after her pattern; but my
temper just then happened to be perverse and
my mood obnoxious to sentiment.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said I, pretending to stare at the
water, &#8216;what&#8217;s the difference between being
lowered in a coffin and being hove overboard
in a canvas sack with a lump of holystone at
one&#8217;s feet, when one doesn&#8217;t know it? If one
could believe in the mermaid, in coral pavilions
illuminated with cressets brilliant with sea-fire,
in those sweet songs which were formerly
sung by <i>fishy</i> virgins, who swept their lyres of
gold with arms of ivory and fingers of pearl,
I believe that when my time came I should
be very willing to take the plunge, in fact
<i>choose</i> it in preference to&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;</p>

<p>I brought my eyes away from the water,
and saw her figure in the companion-way
down which she floated!</p>

<p>A minute later, Colonel Bannister came
along. He approached me close, staring hard,
and said: &#8216;Oh, it&#8217;s you, Dugdale! I thought
it was the second-mate. Here&#8217;s a pretty go!
There&#8217;s a man dead.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He couldn&#8217;t help it, colonel,&#8217; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>&#8216;Ay, but what did he die of?&#8217; he shouted.
&#8216;I&#8217;ve asked Hemmeridge, and he won&#8217;t give
the disease a name. I don&#8217;t want it to go
further, but betwixt you and me and the bedpost,
hang me&#8217;&mdash;here he subdued his voice
into an extraordinary croaking whisper&mdash;&#8216;if
I don&#8217;t believe that Hemmeridge&#8217;&mdash;and he
lifted his hand to his mouth in a posture of
drinking. &#8216;My contention is, they&#8217;ve got no
right to keep the body. What&#8217;s the good of
it? Since Hemmeridge is mute, who&#8217;s going
to say that the seaman didn&#8217;t die of smallpox?
That&#8217;s it, you see! Smallpox! and a crowd
of creatures forward who are infernally negligent
in cleanliness, as all sailors are, not to
mention a mob of us aft who, if a plague should
break out, must perish. Mind, I say <i>perish</i>!
Where&#8217;s that second-mate?&#8217;</p>

<p>He impetuously crossed the deck and
hurried forward on the weather side of the
poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;Beg pardon, sir,&#8217; said the fellow at the
wheel, speaking in a deep, bass, salt voice;
&#8216;&#8217;tain&#8217;t for the likes of me to say nothen,
leastways here;&#8217; he made a step to leeward,
holding a spoke at arm&#8217;s-length, to expectorate
over the rail, and then returned: &#8216;but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
I&#8217;ve heerd the bo&#8217;sun say as that you&#8217;ve been
a sailor-man in your day, and I know that the
gent that&#8217;s just left &#8217;ee is a sojer. And I
should ha&#8217; taken it very koind if, when he
told ye that we was an oncleanly lot forrards,
you&#8217;d ha&#8217; called him a bloomin&#8217; liar.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So he is, my man,&#8217; said I, &#8216;whether I tell
him so or not.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve been a-sailing in troopships ower and
ower again,&#8217; exclaimed the fellow, half-stifling
himself, to subdue his angry voice, &#8216;and I
could tell that there gent this&mdash;that spite of
all his pipeclay and the ship-shape looks of
him outside, there ain&#8217;t an oncleanlier man
than the <i>guffy</i>. You let him know that, sir;
and if he dorn&#8217;t believe it, and the capt&#8217;n&#8217;ll
gi&#8217; me leave, smite me! if I won&#8217;t ondertake
to argue it out wi&#8217; him to the satisfaction of
every party as chooses for to listen, either
aft&#8217;&mdash;striking the wheel a blow with his immense
fist; &#8216;or forrads&#8217;&mdash;another blow; &#8216;or
down in the hold&#8217;&mdash;a third blow; &#8216;or up in
that there maintop;&#8217; and here he fetched his
thigh a whack that sounded like the report of
a firearm.</p>

<p>&#8216;Wheel there! where are you driving the
ship to?&#8217; shouted the second-mate from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
forward part of the poop; but merely as an
excuse, I think, to break away from the
colonel, who had now tailed on to him.</p>

<p>As he came rumbling aft, I went forward.</p>

<p>It was the most delicate gentle weather
imaginable next morning when I went on
deck an hour before breakfast-time to get a
cold bath in the ship&#8217;s head, which to my
mind is the very noblest luxury the sea has to
yield: nothing to be done but to strip, drop
over the side on to the grating betwixt the
headboards, well out of sight of the poop,
where the spout of the head-pump, as it is
called, commands you, and so be played on
for half-an-hour at a spell by some ordinary
seaman, who will be glad to oblige you for
the value of a glass of grog. Oh, the delight
past language of the sensation sinking through
and through one to the very marrow that
comes with the gushing of the sparkling green
brine pouring away from one in foam back
into the flashing heart of the deep out of
which it is sucked!</p>

<p>As I passed the fore-hatch on my way aft,
I observed a heap of something lying under a
tarpaulin; at the same moment the boatswain
stepped out of his berth.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&#8216;Have ye heard what time the funeral&#8217;s to
take place, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Bless me!&#8217; cried I with a start, &#8216;I had
forgotten all about it. Small wonder that we
and our troubles should be compared to
sparks that fly upwards, for we are extinguished
in a breath and clean forgotten.&#8217; I
glanced at the tarpaulin on the hatchway with
an ugly shuddering recollection coming upon
me of the face of the man as I had last viewed
him dead in his bunk. &#8216;No,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I am
unable to tell you when they mean to bury
him. The sooner the better, I should say.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;True for you, sir,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;here
are some of our chaps swearing that they had
bad dreams last night, all a-owing to this here
dead man a-lying here. The fact is Crabb
wasn&#8217;t no favourite, and since he&#8217;s made his
hexit, as the saying is, the men want him gone
for true.&#8217;</p>

<p>As he said this, the third-mate, Mr. Playford,
came forward singing out for the boatswain.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here, sir,&#8217; answered Smallridge in a voice
like the low of a calf.</p>

<p>The officer crossed the hatch, taking care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to give the heap under the tarpaulin a wide
berth.</p>

<p>&#8216;Funeral&#8217;s to take place at four bells,
bo&#8217;sun,&#8217; said he.&mdash;&#8216;Good morning, Mr. Dugdale.
All hands to be cleaned up and attend.
Pity there&#8217;s no more wind, Mr. Dugdale.
The trades are consumedly slow of
coming. Four bells, bo&#8217;sun, d&#8217;ye hear? All
hands&mdash;the big ensign&mdash;four pall-bearers,&#8217; he
added with a grin&mdash;&#8216;everything to be ship-shape
and in Bristol fashion&mdash;to please the
ladies,&#8217; he added, looking at me with one eye
shut.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, now you know all about it, Mr.
Smallridge,&#8217; said I, and walked aft with Mr.
Playford; and the breakfast-bell then sounding,
I entered the cuddy and took my
place.</p>

<p>I had thought to catch a glance, perhaps
<i>one</i> glance, during the meal from Miss Temple,
who might probably recollect her few words
with me on the preceding evening, and her
cool trick of sliding off to let me talk aloud
to myself. But she never turned her eyes my
way. She sometimes spoke across the table
to Mr. Colledge, once inclined her fine figure
towards Captain Keeling to respond to some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
remark of his, and occasionally exchanged a
sentence with her aunt. But the rest of us
might have been as much hidden as the body
of Crabb was forward, for all the attention she
honoured us with.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am glad that this funeral is going to
take place,&#8217; Mr. Johnson said to me. &#8216;I have
promised a friend of mine who owns a newspaper
in London a series of articles on this
voyage, and down to this time I haven&#8217;t quite
seen my way. For what has happened proper
to tell? Dash my wig! saving that collision,
of which I couldn&#8217;t make head nor tail,
and dare not therefore attempt, what ghost of
an incident good for what I may call word-painting
has occurred?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This burial should give you the chance
you want,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; he exclaimed; &#8216;I shall be able to
do it justice, I believe. I am a little uncertain
in the matter of nautical terms; and
when I&#8217;ve finished the account of it, I should
be glad if you&#8217;d listen to it, Mr. Dugdale, and
correct any trifling technical errors I may
happen to make. Even now, I&#8217;ll be shot if I
can tell the difference between starboard and
larboard&mdash;never can remember, somehow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
The words are so confoundedly alike, you
know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If I were you,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I should not suffer
ignorance of the sea-life to hinder me from
writing fully about it. Few sailors read; nobody
else understands the calling. Say what
you like, and you need only dash your absurdities
into your canvas with a cocksure brush
to be accepted as an authority.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Still,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;in an account of a
funeral at sea I should like to have the rigging
right; nor in a description which,&#8217; added he
complacently, &#8216;is not likely to be wanting in
some of the choicer qualities of poetry, would
it be desirable, insignificant as the error might
be in the eyes of landsmen, to mistake the
mainmast for, let me say, the spanker boom.&#8217;</p>

<p>I assured him that I should be glad to
hear his account when he had written it; and
soon afterwards we left the table and went on
deck.</p>

<p>The ship was this morning a very grand
show of canvas. Her yards were braced just
a little forward; the weather clew of the
mainsail was up; all studdingsails to port
were on her, and aloft she had something of
the look of a line-of-battle ship with her immensely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
square yards rising to the truck, the
great hoist of main topsail, with its four
bands of reef-points, enormously thick shrouds
and big tops, and all the heavens over the
bow and far to port hidden by space upon
space of cloth, effulgent in the sunshine, and
flinging a light of their own upon the blue air
in a sort of liquid gushing of radiance off their
edges, trembling into an exquisite delicacy of
outline like a thinness of ice against the sky.
At the peak flew the red ensign half-mast high,
languidly floating in rich brand-new folds of
sunny crimson to the quiet breathing of the
wind over the quarter. It was a hint of what
was to come, and you noticed the influence of
it upon the passengers, who talked in subdued
voices, and walked thoughtfully, as though it
were the Sabbath and Divine service was
shortly to be held. There was nothing in
sight the wide and gleaming circle round,
saving the shoulders of a group of huge cream-coloured
clouds down in the west, looking
like the mountainous loom of a snow-whitened
country.</p>

<p>Shortly before ten o&#8217;clock, Smallridge,
taking his stand upon the forecastle head,
applied his silver whistle to his lips, and sent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the shrill metallic summons ringing throughout
the length of the ship, following it with a
deep-chested hurricane roar of &#8216;All hands
&#8217;tend funeral.&#8217; The Jacks had been off work
since breakfast time, and to the boatswain&#8217;s
melodious invitation they came tumbling out of
the forecastle all in the spruce warm-weather
attire of those days&mdash;flowing white trousers,
coloured shirts, round jackets, collars lying
open to half way down their breasts, half a
fathom of silk handkerchief worked up into
the sailor&#8217;s knot, and, for the most part, round
hats of straw, shaped like a tall hat of to-day,
but the crown considerably lower. They
came soberly rolling along in bunches of three
and four, and massed themselves forward of
the gangway and round about the hatchway,
and the huge pillar of mast shooting up abaft
it. In the foreground stood Smallridge, with
three rows of cloth buttons to his jacket, his
storm-beaten face luminous with recent rinsing,
and his cheeks framed by a pair of upright
collars such as the negro minstrel of
our time loves to embellish his blackened
countenance with. Next him was the sailmaker,
his small blood-stained eyes restlessly
rolling themselves aft upon the people on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
poop from either side his high Roman nose.
By his side was the cook, a fat, bilious-looking
man; and close to him the carpenter, a
withered old Scotchman, with a face of leather,
puckered into a thousand wrinkles by time,
weather, and trials of temper.</p>

<p>The first, third, and fourth mates took
their place a little abaft the gangway, leaving
the second officer on the poop to look after
the ship. A young reefer clad in bright buttons
stood at the bell, which he struck in
funereal time, constantly glancing around him
to find some one to exchange a grin with.
When all were assembled the skipper stalked
solemnly out of the cuddy, Prayer-book in
hand. He was dressed as the officers were, in
a long blue coat with black velvet lapels, cuffs,
and collar, and white jean pantaloons. The
only feature that distinguished his costume
from that of the mates was the undecorated
coat-cuffs; whereas the chief-mate had one
button on his wrist, the third-mate three, and
the fourth-mate four. Keeling was a man of
strong piety, and his manner of addressing
himself to this solemn business was full of an
old-fashioned awe and reverence, which one
might look a long way round among modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
sea captains to find the like of, in such a performance,
at all events, as that of burying the
remains of a forecastle hand. Most of the
passengers were grouped along the break of
the poop to witness the ceremony. I see that
large and stirring picture very freshly even
now: the mass of whiskered faces, one showing
past another, nearly every jaw moving to
the gnawing of a quid; Keeling and his officers
in full fig; the many-coloured dresses of the
ladies fluttering along the line of the poop
rail; I recall the deep hush that settled down
upon the fine ship, no sound to break it but
the tolling of the bell and a noise of water
lazily washing alongside. High above us the
great squares of canvas rose in brilliant clouds,
one swelling to another with a soft swaying of
the whole majestic fabric, as though the vessel
were something sentient, and was keeping
time with her mastheads to the mournful
chimes on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>The bell ceased; the midshipman struck
ten o&#8217;clock upon it; the Jacks on the quarter-deck
made a lane, and down it from forward
came four hearty seamen, bearing upon their
shoulders a hatch grating, on which was the
hammock containing the body, covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
England&#8217;s commercial ensign. One end of
this grating was rested upon the lee rail; then
the captain began to read the sea funeral service.
Mr. Johnson, who stood near me, stared
thirstily at the scene; and methought Mr.
Emmett, who was perched on the rail to windward,
rolled his eye over the mass of colour
that softened and brightened as the movement
of the ship shifted the shadows, as though
some fancies of a startling canvas to be wrought
out of the spectacle were stirring in his mind.
The captain paused in his delivery; the ensign
was whipped off, the grating tilted, and the
white hammock flashed overboard. I was at
the lee rail, and glanced down into the sea
alongside as the hammock sped from the bulwark.
But the ocean coffin, instead of sinking,
went floating astern like a lifebuoy,
bobbing bravely upon the summer tumble,
and lifting and sinking upon the swell as
duck-like as a waterborne lifeboat.</p>

<p>I believe no man saw this but myself,
everybody listening reverentially to the closing
words of the skipper&#8217;s recital from the Prayer-book.
I walked hastily aft to observe the
hammock as it veered into our wake, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
beckoned to Mr. Cocker, who at once crossed
the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;See there!&#8217; cried I, pointing to the thing
that was frisking in the eddies upturned by
our keel, and crawling into the distance to the
slow progress of the ship. &#8216;Friend Crabb
seems in no hurry to knock at Davy Jones&#8217;s
door.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I expect the fool of a sailmaker forgot to
weight the body,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Unless,&#8217; he added,
with a little change in his voice, as if he meant
what he said, whilst he did not wish me to
suppose him in earnest, &#8216;the chap was too
great a rascal when alive to sink now that he&#8217;s
nothing but a body.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I thought,&#8217; I exclaimed, &#8216;that wicked
sailors, like Falstaff, had an alacrity in sinking.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you a fact, then, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;I was aboard a ship where we
buried a man that had murdered a negro in
Jamaica. He was a ruffian down to the heels
of his yellow feet, sir, with a deal worse on
his conscience, in our opinion, than even the
blood of a darkey. It was a dead calm when
we dropped him over the side with a twelve-pound
shot at the clews of his hammock.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Down he went; but up he came again, and
lay wobbling under the main chains. The
captain, not liking such a neighbour, ordered
a boat over with a fresh weight for the corpse.
It was another twelve-pound shot, and down
it took him, as all hands expected. But scarce
was the boat hoisted when the chief mate, who
was looking over the rail, sings out quietly:
&#8220;Here&#8217;s Joey again.&#8221; And <i>there</i> lay the hammock
just under the mizzen chains. &#8217;Twas
lucky a breath of wind came along just then
and sneaked the barque away, for had the
calm lasted, the men would have sworn that
the body had got hold of the ship and wouldn&#8217;t
let her move. But as to our being ever able
to sink it&#8217;&mdash;he shook his head, and pointing
to the hammock that was now showing like a
fleck of foam in the tail of our wake, he exclaimed:
&#8216;It&#8217;s the same with Crabb. He&#8217;s of
the sort that Old Davy will have nothing to
do with.&#8217;</p>

<p>The boatswain&#8217;s pipe shrilled out again;
the ceremony was over. The sailors stalked
gravely towards the forecastle, the passengers
distributed themselves about the poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;Quite worth seeing, don&#8217;t you think?&#8217;
said Mr. Johnson, coming up to me in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
manner of a man fresh from a stage performance
that has pleased him. &#8216;Only let me be
sure of my nautical details, and I believe I
can see my way to a very pretty article, Mr.
Dugdale.&#8217;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>A STRANGE CARGO</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> took the north-east trades on the Canary
parallels; but they blew a very light breeze,
occasionally failing us, indeed, with more than
once a positive hint of a shift in the western
sky, though no change happened. Captain
Keeling declared that in all his time he never
remembered the like of so faint a trade-wind.
Indeed, it threatened us with a long passage
to the equator, and again and again I would
feel as vexed as if I had had command of the
ship, and my reputation depended upon her
progress, when I&#8217;d come on deck and find the
long blue heave of the swell gushing to our
port quarter, just freckled by the delicate soft
wind, with scarce a ripple of weight enough
to run into foam, the weather clew of the
mainsail swinging in and out, and the big topsails,
to the curtseying of the ship upon the
swell, coming into the masts with short slaps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
which made each sheet hum like a twanged
harp-wire through its yard-arm sheave-hole.
Very different was all this from my own experience
of the trades when, for days and
days, from twenty-seven degrees north down
to within thirty leagues of the equator, it had
been one long wild thunderous spell of sailing,
foam to the hawse-pipes, every yard and
studdingsail boom straining at its brace as a
racer at its bridle, the white water to leeward
flashing past in a dazzle, like foam from the
sponsons of a paddle-steamer, and all day long
a fine noise of wind roaring between the masts,
and on high the wool-like clouds of the trades
blowing, charged with prismatic hues, transversely
across the line of our course.</p>

<p>Yet we managed to kill the time with some
degree of entertainment to ourselves. Mr.
Greenhew and Mr. Riley were head over ears
in love with Miss Hudson, and were beginning
to talk sarcasm at each other when there were
people near to listen to their conversation.
Mr. Fairthorne was paying very marked attention
to Miss Mary Joliffe. Mynheer Peter
Hemskirk seemed to find something agreeable
in the company of Miss Helen Trevor, an
exceedingly fat, blue-eyed girl, with a bunch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of flaxen ringlets falling before each ear, and
her hair behind dragged up to a tall comb
that sat in an odd staring way upon her head.
There was some sport in all this for quiet observation.
Then there was always a rubber
of whist to be had. Though Colonel Bannister
was often in too peppery a humour to play,
his aristocratic falcon-beaked wife was ever
ready and eager to take a hand, and partners
were never to be wanting when Mr. Adam or
Mr. Saunders or Mr. Hodder was about.</p>

<p>Colledge and I were good friends, and had
long yarns together in our cabin and on deck.
It was, maybe, because we shared a berth that
I was more with him than with the others,
though Mr. Johnson once attempted a stroke
of irony by saying that of course my intimacy
with Mr. Colledge had nothing whatever to do
with the circumstance of his being the son of
a lord, &#8216;which,&#8217; added he, &#8216;speaks well for
your heart, Dugdale, for he has very many
excellent qualities.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Johnson,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I do not think you
very brilliant as a genius, and I am sure you
are not very richly stocked in gifts of satire.
I would advise you to dedicate all you have
in that way to your profession, lest, when you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
come to set up as a book-critic, you will find
yourself <i>gastados</i>, as the Spaniards say&mdash;expended.&#8217;</p>

<p>But to return to Mr. Colledge: the characteristic
I liked him best for was a certain
naïveté. He would speak of his engagement
with Fanny Crawley as a schoolboy might of
a like experience, and not seem to know what
to make of it. One day he was lying in his
bunk smoking a pipe, with his leg over the
edge, his head propped by his arm, his handsome
face flushed, by the heat, and his soft
dark-blue eyes shining as with wine. I had
come warm and fatigued from the poop, and
lay stretched upon the deck on my mattress.
We had been talking of Miss Crawley, and he
had lugged her portrait from his breast-pocket
to have a look at it; which indeed was a habit
of his when he spoke of her, as though he
could hardly persuade himself that he was
engaged without first taking a peep.</p>

<p>&#8216;Upon my word, Dugdale,&#8217; said he languidly,
&#8216;hang me now, if it was not for Fanny
here, I&#8217;d propose to Louise Temple. She&#8217;s a
ripping girl, and the sort of woman my father
would like; a fine stately presence for a drawing-room,
eh? Figure the dignity with which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
she would kiss the hand of a sovereign, making
the business quite the other way about by her
salutation, and queening it to the confusion of
every eye. My father doesn&#8217;t very much care
about Fanny&mdash;has no style, he thinks&mdash;nothing
distinguished about her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But you are engaged to her with his
sanction, I presume?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know,&#8217; he answered.</p>

<p>I laughed, and said: &#8216;Has Miss Temple
heard that you&#8217;re engaged to be married?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; he answered with a small air of confusion;
&#8216;there was no need to tell her. What
should there be in such a confession to interest
her? You&#8217;re the only person on board the
ship that I have mentioned the thing to. Of
course I can trust to <i>you</i>,&#8217; said he, soothingly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Trust me!&#8217; I exclaimed, laughing again.
&#8216;There is nothing wrong surely in this engagement
that you should fear the betrayal of the
secret of it? But since it <i>is</i> a secret, it is
perfectly safe in my keeping.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you think I ought to tell Miss Temple
that I&#8217;m engaged?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, if you are making love to her,&#8217; said
I, &#8216;it might be as well to give her a hint that
you&#8217;re not in earnest.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>&#8216;Oh, but, confound it, I <i>am</i>!&#8217; he cried.
&#8216;I mean,&#8217; he added, catching himself up, &#8216;I
think her a doocidly charming girl, and the
most delightful creature to flirt with that ever
I met in my life; but if I go and tell her I&#8217;m
engaged&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It would knock my association with her
on the head. It is not as if Fanny were
within reach of an early post. Even if I were
disposed to break off my engagement with
her, it must take me some months to do it.
D&#8217;ye understand me?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You mean, of course,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that no
letter can reach her under seven or eight
months, unless, indeed, you conveyed one to
her by a homeward-bound ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay; but putting the homeward-bound
ship aside, Fanny could not knew of my resolution&mdash;were
it ever to come to <i>that</i>&mdash;until
she received the letter I posted to her in
India; therefore, I should have to consider
myself engaged to her all that time.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No doubt,&#8217; said I, beginning to feel bored.</p>

<p>&#8216;Miss Temple would take that view,&#8217; said
he, &#8216;and that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t choose to tell her
the truth.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>&#8216;I don&#8217;t quite follow your logic,&#8217; I exclaimed;
&#8216;but no matter. It may be that
you want too much in the way of sweethearts.
But so far as your secret goes, you
can trust me to hold my tongue. Possibly, I
may admire Miss Temple as warmly as you
do; see qualities in her superior even to her
excellence as a mistress of postures; but I do
not yet love her so passionately as not to wish
to see her chastened a bit by the lesson she
is likely to learn from your delight in her
society.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t understand,&#8217; he exclaimed, lazily
knocking the ashes of his pipe out through
the open porthole.</p>

<p>&#8216;Neither do I,&#8217; cried I, springing to my
legs with a loud yawn. &#8216;Heaven bless us,
my dear Colledge! here are we now, I daresay,
a fair thousand miles from the nearest
African headland. Surely we are distant
enough from all civilisation, then, to be clear
of the influence of the girls! Take my advice,
and keep your heart whole till you get to
India. There may be a Princess waiting for
you there, more likely to value a tiger-hide
offering than Miss Temple; whilst Miss Crawley&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
broken heart will mend apace when she
learns that your wife has a black skin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, hang it all!&#8217; I heard him begin;
but I was sick of the subject, and sauntered
forth to see what was doing on deck.</p>

<p>There was very little wind; indeed, here
and there about the sea were glass-like swathes
riding the quiet pulse of the long slow swell
in scythe-shaped horns, as though, in fact,
there was to be a dead calm anon. Only the
topmost and lightest canvas was asleep; the
heavier cloths hung up and down with no
more of life in them than what they got out
of the heave of the ship; and deep as we yet
were in the heart of the North Atlantic, there
was, it seemed to me, a true tropic touch in
the aspect of things&mdash;in the clear pale blue
of the sky; in the sluggish crawling of the
clouds, with their rounded brows stealing out
in a copperish hue; in the wavering of the
atmosphere over the hot line of the bulwarks,
as though there was a sort of steam going up
from the wood; in the parched look of the
running-gear, and in the salt glistening of the
white planks; in the figures of crimson-faced
men, their feet naked, their arms and chests
bare, again and again coming to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
scuttle butt, lashed a bit forward of the gangway,
and drinking from the metal dipper.</p>

<p>When I arrived on the poop, I found the
captain standing aft surrounded by a number
of ladies, directing a binocular glass at the sea
over the starboard bow. The chief mate at
the head of the poop ladder was likewise
staring into the same quarter, with Mr. Johnson
alongside, bothering him with questions,
and little Saunders on tip-toe, to see over the
rail, fanning his face with a large flapping
black wide-awake.</p>

<p>I stepped to the side to look, and saw
some object about a mile distant, that emitted
a wet flash of light from time to time. I
asked the mate to lend me his glass, and at
once made the thing out to be a capsized hull
of a vessel of about eighty tons. She floated
almost to the line of her yellow sheathing,
and the gold-like metal rising wet to the sun
from the soft sweep of the blue brine darted
flashes as dazzling as flame from the mouth of
a cannon.</p>

<p>I returned the glass to Mr. Prance.</p>

<p>&#8216;She has not been long in that condition,
I think?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not twenty-four hours, I should say,&#8217; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
answered. &#8216;I see no wreckage floating about
her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nor I. If she had a crew on board when
she turned turtle,&#8217; I said, &#8216;she may have
clapped down upon them as you imprison
flies under a tumbler.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;God bless us, what a dreadful death to
die!&#8217; cried little Saunders. &#8216;I can conceive
of no agony to equal that of being in a cabin
in a sinking ship and going down with her,
and <i>knowing</i> that she is under water and still
settling.&#8217;</p>

<p>The little chap shuddered and pulled out
a great blue pocket-handkerchief, with which
he dried his forehead.</p>

<p>&#8216;How long could a man live in a cabin
under water?&#8217; asked Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p>&#8216;Long enough to come off with his life,&#8217;
answered the mate, bringing the glass from
his eye and looking at Mr. Johnson. &#8216;I&#8217;ll
give you a queer yarn in a few words, sir;
wild enough to furnish out an A1 copper-bottomed
sea-tale to some one of you literary
gentlemen. A small vessel was dismasted
&#8217;twixt Tariffa and Tangier in the middle of the
Gut there. All her crew saving one man got
away in the boat. The fellow that was left<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
lay drunk in the cabin. A sea shifted her
cargo; shortly after she capsized and went
down. A few days later, that same ship
floated up from the bottom of the sea
on to the shore near Tangier. She was
boarded, and they found the man alive in the
cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What was the vessel&#8217;s cargo, Mr. Prance?&#8217;
inquired little Saunders.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oil and brandy, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t you think,&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Johnson,
&#8216;that your story is one that would be very
acceptable to the marines, Mr. Prance, but
that would not be believed by your sailors
were you to tell it to them?&#8217;</p>

<p>Here the captain, who had been slowly
coming forward, accompanied by half-a-dozen
ladies, interrupted us.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Prance.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That object yonder is a danger in the
way of navigation. I think it would be kind
in us to send a shot at it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We will shift the helm,&#8217; continued old
Keeling, in the skewered, buttoned-up sort
of voice and air he was wont to use when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
addressing his mates in the presence of the
passengers, &#8216;so as to bring the wreck within
reach of our carronades.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very good, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I expect,&#8217; continued old marline-spike,
&#8216;that she is floating on the air in her hold
rather than on her cargo, even though it be
cork; and if we can knock a hole in her, she
will sink.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Prance stepped aft to the wheel, and
the vessel&#8217;s course was changed. Instructions
went forward; and the boatswain, who combined
with his duties the functions of chief-gunner
aboard the <i>Countess Ida</i>, superintended
the loading of a couple of pieces.</p>

<p>&#8216;Please tell me when they are going to
fire, Mr. Riley, that I may stop my ears,&#8217; cried
Miss Hudson, who looked a very lovely little
woman that morning in a wide straw hat and
a body of some muslin-like material, through
which the snow of her throat and neck showed,
making you think of a white rose in a crystal
vase.</p>

<p>Mr. Greenhew, with a glance full of scissors
and thumbscrews, as sailors say, at Mr. Riley,
told Miss Hudson that if she objected to the
noise, he would insist that the gun should not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
be fired, and would make it a personal matter
between himself and the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not for worlds, thank you very much all
the same,&#8217; said Miss Hudson, sending a languishing
look at him through her eyelashes;
which, being witnessed by Mr. Riley, would,
I did not doubt, occasion a large expenditure
of sarcasm between the young men later on.</p>

<p>The motion of the ship was very slow, and
we had floated almost imperceptibly down
upon the wreck. The skipper then suggested
that the ladies should go aft, and off they went
in a flutter and huddle of many-coloured
gowns, Mrs. Colonel Bannister leading the
way, and Mrs. Hudson limping in the wake
with her fingers in her ears. A chap with a
purple face and immense whiskers was sighting
the piece.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let fly now, whenever you are ready,&#8217;
shouted Mr. Prance.</p>

<p>There was a roaring explosion; Mr. Johnson
recoiled on to the feet of Mr. Emmett, who
shouted with pain, and went hopping to the
skylight with a foot in his hand. There were
several screeches from the ladies, and methought
the whiskers of the colonel, who stood
beside me thirstily looking on, forked out with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
an added tension of every separate fibre, to the
thunder of the gun and the smell of the powder.
The ball flew wide.</p>

<p>&#8216;Another shot!&#8217; called out Mr. Prance.</p>

<p>Bang! went the piece. I had my eye on
the wreck at that moment, and saw half the
stern-post, from which the rudder was gone,
and a few feet of the keel to which it was
affixed, vanish like a shattered bottle.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s done it!&#8217; cried old Keeling with
excitement as he stood ogling the wreck through
his binocular. &#8216;If a hole that&#8217;ll let the air out
is to sink her, she&#8217;s as good as foundered.&#8217;</p>

<p>He had scarcely said this when there was a
sudden roar of voices along the whole length
of our ship.</p>

<p>&#8216;See! she is full of men!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Heart alive, where are they coming
from?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;re rising as if they were dead bodies,
and the last blast was sounding.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;ll they be? What&#8217;ll they be?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Defend us! they must all be afloat in a
minute and drowning!&#8217;</p>

<p>Fifty exclamations of this kind rolled along
the bulwarks, where the sailors had gathered
in their full company to watch the effect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the shot. There was no glass within reach of
me; but my sight was keen, and at the first
blush I believed that the hull had been a
slaver, that she had capsized when full of
negroes, and that our round-shot had made a
man-hole aft big enough for them to escape
through. There were twenty or thirty of
them. They came thrusting through the
aperture with extraordinary agility, and most
of them held a very firm seat on the clean line
of the keel. But every now and again one or
another of them would lose his balance and
slide down the hard bright surface of the
yellow sheathing upon the round of the bilge
plump into the water, where you would observe
him making frantic but idle efforts to reclimb
the wet and slippery slope.</p>

<p>&#8216;Monkeys, as I am a man!&#8217; roared Mr.
Prance.</p>

<p>&#8216;A cargo of monkeys, sir!&#8217; shouted the
skipper from the other end of the poop, whilst
he kept his glasses levelled at the wreck.</p>

<p>A sort of groaning note of astonishment,
followed by a wild shout of laughter, came
along from the Jacks. Indeed, one needed to
look hard at the thing to believe in it, so incredibly
odd was the incident. One moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the wreck was a mere curve of naked yellow
sheathing flashing to the sun as it rolled; the
next, pouff! went the thunder of the gun, and
as though its grinning adamantine lips owned
some magical and diabolical potency of invocation,
lo! the hole made by the shot was
vomiting monkeys, and in a trice the radiant
rounds of the keel-up fabric were covered with
the figures of squatting, clinging, grinning
creatures of all sizes, some like little hairy
babies, some like men as large at least as Mr.
Saunders.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;ll be a human being rising out of
that hole before long, I expect,&#8217; said Mr. Prance.
&#8216;He must needs be slower than the monkeys
if he&#8217;s a man. How many d&#8217;ye make, Mr.
Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Some thirty or forty,&#8217; said I. &#8216;But I tell
you what, Mr. Prance: there&#8217;ll be none left in
a few minutes, for the hull is sinking rapidly.&#8217;</p>

<p>At that instant Captain Keeling sung out:
&#8216;Mr. Prance&mdash;have one of the quarter-boats
manned. It is as I thought&mdash;the hull was
floating on the air in her hold, and she&#8217;s settling
fast. We can&#8217;t let those poor creatures drown.
Get the main topsail backed.&#8217;</p>

<p>A boat&#8217;s crew came bundling aft to the cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
of the mate; in a mighty hurry the gripes
were cast adrift, and the tackles slackened
away with the men in their places, and the
fourth officer in the stern sheets shipping the
rudder as the boat sank. There was a deal
of confusion for the moment, what with the
tumbling aft of the sailors, the passengers
getting out of their road, the hubbub of ladies&#8217;
voices, and the cries of the seamen dragging
upon the weather main-braces to back the
yards.</p>

<p>&#8216;There she goes!&#8217; cried I; &#8216;there&#8217;ll not
be many of the creatures rescued, I believe.
Monkeys are indifferent swimmers.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lively now, Mr. Jenkinson,&#8217; yelled Mr.
Prance to the fourth officer, &#8216;or they&#8217;ll all be
drowned.&#8217;</p>

<p>The chaps gave way with a will, and the
boat buzzed towards the patch of little black
heads that rose and sank upon the swell as
though a sack of cocoa-nuts had been capsized
out there. All hands stood gazing in silence.
The drowning struggle of a single beast is a
pitiful sight; but to see a crowd perishing, a
whole mob of brutes horribly counterfeiting
the aspect and motions of suffering humanity
with their faces and gestures, is painful, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
indeed intolerable. The ladies had come to the
forward end of the poop out of the way of
the seamen pulling upon the main brace, and
I found myself next to Miss Temple at the
rail.</p>

<p>&#8216;They <i>are</i> monkeys, I suppose?&#8217; she said,
swiftly shooting a glance of her black eyes
at me, and then staring again seawards with
her pale face as passionless as a piece of
carving, and nothing to show that she was
in the least degree moved by the excitement
of the scene of drowning monkeys and speeding
boat, saving her parted lips, as though
she breathed a little fast.</p>

<p>&#8216;They are as much monkeys,&#8217; said I, &#8216;as
fur and tails can make a creature.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you suppose there were living people
locked up in that hold?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;God forbid!&#8217; said I. &#8216;It is not a thing
to conjecture <i>now</i>.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How could those monkeys have lived
without air?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Air there must have been, Miss Temple,
or they could not have lived. The story of
the wreck seems simple enough to my mind.
She was, no doubt, a little schooner from the
Brazilian coast, bound to a European port<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
with a freight of monkeys, which are always
a saleable commodity. They would be
stowed away somewhere aft in the run, perhaps,
as it is called. The vessel capsized,
and floated, as Captain Keeling suggested,
upon the air in her. Our cannon-ball
knocked a hole in the hulk right over the
monkeys&#8217; quarters, and out they came. I
can tell you of more wonderful things than
that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She must have <i>capsized</i>, as you call it,
very recently,&#8217; said she, glancing at me again&mdash;it
was rarely more than a glance with her,
as though she believed that such beauty as
her eyes had entitled them to a royal privacy.</p>

<p>&#8216;No doubt,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>By this time the boat had reached the
spot where the hulk had foundered, and we
could see the men lying over the side picking
up the monkeys. I ran my gaze eagerly
over the surface there, somehow fancying
that one or more bodies of men might rise;
but there was nothing in that way to be seen.
The boat lingered with the fellows in her
standing up and looking around them. They
then reseated themselves, the oars sparkled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
and presently the little fabric came rushing
through the water to alongside.</p>

<p>&#8216;How many have you picked up, Mr.
Jenkinson!&#8217; cried the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;Only eight, sir. I believe they were half
dead with hunger and thirst, and had no
strength to swim, for most of them had sunk
before we could approach them.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hand the poor brutes up.&#8217;</p>

<p>Some of the Jacks jumped into the chains
to receive the creatures, and they were
passed over the rail on to the quarter-deck.
Deeply as one might pity the unhappy brutes,
it was impossible to look at them with a
grave face. One of them was an ape with
white whiskers like a frill, and a tuft of hair
upon his brow that made the rest of his head
look bald. He had lost an eye, but the other
blinker was so full of human expression that
I found myself shaking with laughter as I
watched him. He sat on his hams like a
Lascar, gazing up at us with his one eye
with a wrinkled and grinning countenance of
appeal grotesque beyond the wildest fancies
of the caricaturist. There was one pretty
little chap with red fur upon his breast like a
waistcoat. Some of the creatures, on feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the warm planks of the deck, lay down in the
exact posture of human beings, reposing their
heads upon their extended arms and closing
their eyes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bo&#8217;sun,&#8217; called Mr. Prance, &#8216;get those
poor beasts forward and have water and food
given them. Swing the topsail yard&mdash;lee
main topsail braces.&#8217;</p>

<p>In a few minutes the quarter-deck was
clear again, with an ordinary seaman swabbing
the wet spaces left by the monkeys, and
the ship quietly pushing forwards on her
course.</p>

<small>A SECRET BLOW</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">At</span> sea, a very little thing goes a very long
way, and you will suppose that this incident
of the monkeys gave us plenty to talk about
and to wonder at. At the dinner table that
evening old Keeling favoured us with a long
yarn about a French craft that capsized somewhere
off the Scilly Islands with four men in
her: how the air in her hold kept her buoyant;
how the fellows climbed into the run
and sat with their heads against the ship&#8217;s
bottom; how one of them strove with might
and main to knock a plank out, that he might
see if help was about, in nowise suspecting
that if he let the air escape the hull would
sink; how, all unknown to the wretched imprisoned
men, a smack fell in with the capsized
craft and tried to tow her, but gave up
after the line had parted two or three times;
how she finally stranded upon one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Scilly Isles; and how one of the inhabitants
coming down to view the wreck, shot away
as though the devil were in chase of him, on
hearing the sound of voices inside.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson whispered to me: &#8216;I <i>don&#8217;t</i>
believe it;&#8217; and Colonel Bannister listened
with a fine incredulous stare fixed upon the
skipper&#8217;s crimson countenance; but the rest
of us were vastly interested, especially the
elder ladies, who, behind old Keeling&#8217;s back,
spoke of him as &#8216;a love.&#8217;</p>

<p>We settled it amongst us to purchase the
monkeys from the boat&#8217;s crew which had
rescued them, leaving the ape for the seamen
to make a pet of. The matter was talked
over at that dinner, and I overheard Miss
Temple ask Mr. Colledge to try to secure the
little monkey with the red waistcoat for her.
She was the only one of the ladies who wanted
a monkey.</p>

<p>&#8216;Would <i>you</i> like one, Miss Hudson?&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>She shuddered in the prettiest way.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I hate monkeys,&#8217; she cried; &#8216;they
are so like men, you know!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then, by every law of logic,&#8217; bawled the
colonel with a loud laugh, &#8216;you must hate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
men more, madam. Don&#8217;t you see?&mdash;ha! ha!
Why do you hate monkeys? Because they
are like men. How much, then, must you
hate men, the original of the monkey!&#8217;</p>

<p>He roared with laughter again. In fact,
there never was a man who more keenly
relished his own sallies of wit than Colonel
Bannister.</p>

<p>Miss Hudson coloured, and fanned herself.</p>

<p>&#8216;I hate monkeys too,&#8217; cried Mr. Greenhew,
&#8216;and for the reason that makes Miss
Hudson averse to them;&#8217; and here he looked
very hard at the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, certainly a fellow-feeling don&#8217;t
<i>always</i> make us kind,&#8217; murmured Mr. Riley
in an audible voice, and putting a glass into
his eye to look around him as he laughed.</p>

<p>Here the steward said something in a low
voice to Mr. Prance, who looked at me, and
said in a hollow tragic tone: &#8216;Five of the
monkeys have gone dead, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>I called the news down the table to the
captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry to hear it, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; he answered
in a dry voice; &#8216;but you don&#8217;t want
me to open a subscription list for the widows,
do ye?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>&#8216;Can any one say if the little chap with
the red waistcoat&#8217;s dead?&#8217; cried Mr. Colledge.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dead hand gone, sir,&#8217; exclaimed the cockney
head steward.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is left of the lot?&#8217; inquired Keeling.</p>

<p>&#8216;The hape, sir; and the two little chaps
that was rescued with their tails half ate up,
as is supposed by themselves,&#8217; responded the
steward.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson burst out a-laughing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tails eaten up!&#8217; cried Mrs. Bannister,
poising a pair of gold glasses upon her Roman
nose as she addressed the captain. &#8216;Are
there any sharks here?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I should say not, madam,&#8217; answered the
skipper. &#8216;It is a trick monkeys fall into of
biting their own tails, as human beings gnaw
their finger-nails.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And when they have consumed their
tails, Captain Keeling,&#8217; said Mrs. Hudson, in a
rather vulgar voice, &#8216;do they go on with the
rest of themselves?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe they are only hindered, madam,&#8217;
said Keeling, with a grave face, &#8216;by discovering
themselves, after a given limit, somewhat
inaccessible.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I dislike monkeys,&#8217; said Mrs. Joliffe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
Mr. Saunders; &#8216;but I should imagine that
natural philosophers would find their habits
and tastes very interesting subjects for study.&#8217;</p>

<p>The little chap moved uneasily in his
chair, with a half-glance up and down, to see
if anybody smiled.</p>

<p>&#8216;The monkey eating his tail,&#8217; exclaimed
Mr. Emmett, &#8216;is to my mind a very beautiful
symbol.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Of what?&#8217; inquired Mr. Hodder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Of a dissipated young man devouring the
fortune left him,&#8217; answered Mr. Emmett.</p>

<p>&#8216;Very true; very good, indeed!&#8217; cried
Mr. Adams, the lawyer, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The death of the monkeys extinguished
the scheme of purchasing them. The one-eyed
ape was not to be thought of; and now
it was known that the tails of the other survivors
were merely stumps, the subject was
very unanimously dropped, and the three poor
beasts left for the sailors to do what they
pleased with.</p>

<p>As an incident, the matter might have
served for the day, so dull is life on shipboard
with nothing to look forward to but mealtime.
But something else was to happen that
evening.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>Two bells&mdash;nine o&#8217;clock&mdash;had been struck.
Most of the passengers were below, for there
was a deal of dew in the air, too much of it
for the thin dresses of the ladies, who, through
the skylight, were to be seen reading and
chatting in the cuddy, with a party of whist-players
at the table, Mr. Emmett&#8217;s and Mr.
Hodder&#8217;s noses close together over a cribbage
board, and Colledge at chess with Miss
Temple, Miss Hudson opposite, leaning her
shining head on her arm bare to the elbow, a
faultless limb indeed, watching them. The
breeze had freshened at sundown. There
was a half-moon in the heavens, with a tropic
brightness of disc, and the ocean under her
light spread away to its limits in a surface
firm and dark as polished indigo, saving that
under the planet there was a long trembling
wake, and an icy sparkle in the eastern waters,
over which some large, most beautiful star
was hanging; but though there was breeze
enough to put a merry rippling into the sea,
the feathering of each little surge was too
delicate to catch the eye, unless the white
water broke close; and the deep brimmed to
the distant luminaries, a mighty shadow.</p>

<p>The skipper was below; Mr. Cocker had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
charge of the deck, and I joined him in his
walk. He talked of the monkeys, how the
poor wretches had died one after another in
the forecastle.</p>

<p>&#8216;I saw one of them die,&#8217; said he: &#8216;upon
my life, Mr. Dugdale, it was like seeing a
human being expire. I don&#8217;t wonder women
dislike that kind of beasts. For my part, I
regard monkeys as poor relations.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What were the men laughing at, shortly
after we had come up from dinner?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, sir, at little John Chinaman. The
ape was on the fore-hatch, secured by a piece
of line round his waist. Johnny went to have
a look at him. There was nobody about&mdash;at
least he thought so. He stared hard at the
ape, who viewed him eagerly with his one
eye, and then said: &#8220;I say, where you from,
hey?&#8221; The ape continued to look. &#8220;Oh,
you can speakee,&#8221; continued John; &#8220;me
savee you can for speakee. Why you no talkee,
hey? Me ask where you from? Where you
from?&#8221; The ape caught a flea. &#8220;How you
capsize, hey?&#8221; asked the Chinese lunatic as
gravely, Mr. Dugdale, so the men say, as if he
were addressing you or me. &#8220;Speakee soft&mdash;how
you capsize, hey?&#8221; This went on, I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
told, for ten minutes, the men meanwhile
coming on tip-toe to listen over the forecastle
edge till they could stand it no longer, and
their roar of laughter was what you heard,
sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A mere bit of sham posture-making in
Johnny, don&#8217;t you think?&#8217; said I. &#8216;He might
guess the men were listening. Had he been
a negro, now. But a Chinaman would very
well know that a monkey can&#8217;t talk.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This John is one who doesn&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ll
swear. Besides, sir, the Chinese are not such
geniuses as are imagined. There are thousands
amongst them to correspond with our
ignorant superstitious peasantry at home. I
remember at Chusan that four Chinamen
were engaged to carry a piano out of the
cabin. Whilst they were wrestling with it on
the quarter-deck, a string broke with a loud
<i>twang</i>, on which they put the instrument
down and ran away, viewing it from a distance
with faces working with alarm and
astonishment. The mate called to know
what they meant by dropping their work.
&#8220;Him spirit! him speakee,&#8221; they cried; in
fact, they would have no more to do with the
piano; and when some of the crew picked it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
up to carry it to the gangway, the quivering
Johns went backing and recoiling on to the
forecastle, as though the instrument were a
cage with a wild beast in it that might at any
moment spring out on them.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whilst he was speaking I had been watching
a star slowly creeping away from the edge
of the mainsail to leeward, as though it were
sweeping through the sky on its own account
on a course parallel with the line of the
horizon. My attention was fixed on what my
companion said, and my gaze rested mechanically
upon the star. Suddenly the truth
flashed upon me, and I started.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Mr. Cocker, what&#8217;s happening to
the ship? Are we going home again? She
is coming to rapidly! You will be having all
your stun&#8217;-sails there to larboard aback in a
minute.&#8217;</p>

<p>He had been too much engrossed by our
chat to notice this.</p>

<p>&#8216;Wheel there!&#8217; he shouted, running aft
as he cried. &#8216;What are you doing with the
ship? Port your hellum, man, port your
hellum!&#8217;</p>

<p>I hastily followed, to see what was the
matter. The wheel was deserted, and as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
approached, I saw the circle revolve against
the stars over the taffrail like a windmill in a
gale. Alongside, prone on the deck, his arms
outstretched and his face down, was the figure
of the helmsman.</p>

<p>&#8216;He is in a fit,&#8217; cried the second mate,
grasping the wheel and revolving it, to bring
the ship to her course again.</p>

<p>Here Captain Keeling came hastily up the
companion steps.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s the officer of the watch?&#8217; he
shouted.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here, sir,&#8217; answered Cocker from the
wheel.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you know, sir,&#8217; cried the skipper,
&#8216;that you are four points off your course?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The helmsman has fallen down in a fit,
or else lies dead here, sir,&#8217; responded the
second-mate.</p>

<p>The skipper saw how it was, and bawled
for some hands to come aft. Such of the
passengers as were on deck gathered about
the wheel in a group.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is that?&#8217; exclaimed little Mr.
Saunders, stooping close to the prostrate seaman&#8217;s
head. &#8216;Blood, gentlemen!&#8217; he exclaimed.
&#8216;See the great stain of it here!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
This man has been struck down by some
hand.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s that? what&#8217;s that?&#8217; cried old
Keeling, bending his crowbar of a figure to
the stain. &#8216;Ay, he has been struck down as
you say, Mr. Saunders. Who has done this
thing? Look about you, men; see if there&#8217;s
anybody concealed here.&#8217;</p>

<p>Three or four fellows had come tumbling
aft. One took the wheel from the second
mate; and the others, along with the midshipmen
of the watch, fell to peering under
the gratings and into the gig that hung astern
flush with the taffrail, and up aloft; but there
was nothing living to be found, and the great
fabric of mizzen masts and sails whitened to
the truck by the moon, and the yard-arms
showing in black lines against the stars,
soared without blotch or stir, saving here and
there a thin shadow upon the pallid cloths
creeping to the movement of the spars.</p>

<p>Dr. Hemmeridge now arrived. The seaman,
who appeared as dead as a stone, was
turned over, and propped by a couple of
sailors, and the doctor took a view of him by
the help of the binnacle lamp. There was a
desperate gash on the left side of the head.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
The small straw hat that the poor fellow was
wearing was cut through, as though to the
clip of a chopper. There was a deal of blood
on the deck, and the man&#8217;s face was ghastly
enough, with its beard encrimsoned and dripping,
to turn the heart sick.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is he dead, think you?&#8217; demanded the
captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;I cannot yet tell,&#8217; answered the doctor.
&#8216;Raise him, men, and carry him forward at
once to his bunk.&#8217;</p>

<p>The sailors, followed by the doctor, went
staggering shadowily under their burden along
the poop and disappeared, leaving a little
crowd of us at the wheel dumb with wonder,
and looking about us with eyes which gleamed
to the flame of the binnacle lamp that Mr.
Cocker yet held.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, <i>how</i> has this happened?&#8217; demanded
old Keeling, after a prolonged squint aloft.
&#8216;Had you left the deck, Mr. Cocker?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir, not for a living instant; Mr. Dugdale
will bear witness to that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is true,&#8217; I said.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did no man from forward come along the
poop?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&#8216;No man, sir; I&#8217;ll swear it,&#8217; answered Mr.
Cocker.</p>

<p>&#8216;Any of you young gentlemen been aloft?&#8217;
said Keeling, addressing the midshipmen.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir,&#8217; answered one of them, &#8216;neither
aloft nor yet abaft the mizzen rigging for the
last half-hour.&#8217;</p>

<p>The old chap took the lamp out of Mr.
Cocker&#8217;s hand and looked under the gratings,
then got upon them and stared into the gig,
as though dissatisfied with the earlier inspection
of these hiding-places.</p>

<p>&#8216;Most extraordinary!&#8217; he exclaimed; &#8216;did
some madman do it, and then jump overboard?&#8217;</p>

<p>He looked over the sides to port and starboard.
The quarter galleries were small, with
bumpkins for the main-braces stretching out
from them. They were untenanted.</p>

<p>&#8216;What was the man&#8217;s name, Mr. Cocker?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Simpson, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Was he unpopular forward, do you know?
Had he quarrelled lately with any man?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will inquire, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>Old Keeling seemed as bewildered as a
person newly awakened from a dream; and,
indeed, it was an extraordinary and an incredible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
thing. Mr. Saunders and Mynheer
Hemskirk, with one or two others who were
on the deck at the time, swore that no man
had come aft from the direction of the forecastle.
They were conversing in a group a
little forward of the mizzen mast, and could
take their oaths that there was no living
creature abaft that point at the time of the
occurrence saving the man who had been so
mysteriously felled to the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;He most hov done it himself,&#8217; said Hemskirk.</p>

<p>&#8216;What! Dealt himself a blow that sheared
through his hat into his skull?&#8217; cried old
Keeling.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve been making inquiries, sir,&#8217; said the
second-mate, approaching us, &#8216;and find that
Simpson, instead of being disliked, was a
general favourite. No man has been aft, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Something must have fallen from the
rigging,&#8217; said Mr. Saunders.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; cried the captain in a voice of
mingled wrath and astonishment, &#8216;when anything
falls from aloft, it drops plumb, sir&mdash;up
and down, sir. The law of gravitation, Mr.
Saunders, is the same at sea as it is on shore.
What could fall from those heights up there&#8217;&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
here he turned up his head like a hen in
the act of drinking,&mdash;&#8216;to strike a man standing
at the wheel all that distance away?&#8217;</p>

<p>The news had got wind below, and the
passengers came up in twos and threes from
the cuddy, asking questions as they arrived,
the loudest and most importunate amongst
them, needless to say, being Colonel Bannister.
There was real consternation amongst the
ladies at the sight of the bloodstain. I shall
not easily forget the picture of that poop-full
of people: the staring of the women at the
dark blotch against the wheel, whilst they held
themselves in a sort of posture of recoil, holding
their dresses back, as if something were
crawling at them; the subdued wondering air
of the men, restlessly looking about them, one
going to the rail to gaze over, the dusky form
of another stooping to peer under the gratings,
a third with his head lying back straining his
sight at the airy empearled spire of the cloths
rising from the cross-jack to the royal yard,
the mizzen-top showing clear and firm as a
drawing in Indian ink against the delicate
shimmering concavity of the topsail. The
half-moon rode in brilliance over the main
topgallant yard-arm, and the dark swell rolled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
in soundless heavings to the quarter, with the
wake of the planet lying in the shape of a
silver fan to half way across the ocean, and not
a cloud in the whole wide velvet-black depths
to obscure so much as a thumbnail of stardust.</p>

<p>&#8216;What has happened, Dugdale?&#8217; exclaimed
Colledge, accosting me at once as he rose
through the companion with Miss Temple at
his side.</p>

<p>&#8216;A man that was at the helm has been
struck down,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;By whom?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, that&#8217;s it,&#8217; I answered; &#8216;nobody
knows, and I don&#8217;t think anybody ever will
know.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is he dead?&#8217; asked Miss Temple.</p>

<p>&#8216;I cannot say,&#8217; I responded; &#8216;his hat was
cut through and his head laid open. There is
a dreadful illustration of what has happened
close against the wheel.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In what form?&#8217; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Blood!&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, it&#8217;s <i>murder</i>, then!&#8217; cried Colledge.</p>

<p>&#8216;It looks like it,&#8217; said I, with a glance at
Miss Temple&#8217;s face, that showed white as
alabaster to the moonlight, whilst in each
glowing dark eye sparkled a little star of silver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
far more brilliant than the ice-like flash of the
diamonds which trembled in her ears. &#8216;But
be the assassin what he may, I&#8217;ll swear by
every saint in the calendar that he&#8217;s not
aboard this ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray, explain, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; exclaimed
Miss Temple in a voice of curiosity at once
haughty and peevish.</p>

<p>I made no answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;My dear fellow, what do you want to
imply?&#8217; said Colledge: &#8216;that the man was
struck down&mdash;by somebody out of doors?&#8217;
and his eyes went wandering over the sea.</p>

<p>&#8216;It seems my mission, Miss Temple,&#8217; said
I with a half-laugh, &#8216;to furnish you with information
on what happens on board the
<i>Countess Ida</i>. Once again let me enjoy the
privilege you do me the honour to confer
upon me;&#8217; and with that, in an offhand
manner, I told her the story as you have it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did anybody, think you, crawl out of the
hind windows,&#8217; exclaimed Colledge, &#8216;and
creep up over the stern and strike the man
down?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;How did it happen, then?&#8217; asked Miss
Temple fretfully.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>&#8216;Why,&#8217; I answered, looking at her, &#8216;the
blow was no doubt dealt by a spirit.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Lor&#8217; bless us, how terrifying!&#8217; exclaimed
Mrs. Hudson, who, unknown to me, had
drawn to my elbow to listen. &#8216;What with
the heat and the sight of that blood!&#8217; she
cried, fanning herself violently. &#8216;A spirit,
did you say, sir? Oh, I shall never be able
to sleep in the ship again after this.&#8217;</p>

<p>I edged away, finding little pleasure in the
prospect of a chat with Mrs. Hudson with
Miss Temple close at hand to listen to us. At
that moment Dr. Hemmeridge made his appearance.
He stalked up to the captain, who
stood with his hand gripping the vang of the
spanker gaff, returning short almost gruff
answers to the questions fired at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;The man&#8217;s alive, sir,&#8217; said the doctor;
&#8216;but he&#8217;s badly hurt. I&#8217;ve soldered his wound;
but it is an ugly cut.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is he conscious?&#8217; demanded Keeling.</p>

<p>&#8216;He is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And what does he say?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He has nothing to say, sir. How should
he remember, Captain Keeling? He fell to
the blow as an ox would.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; cried the skipper; &#8216;but does he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
recollect seeing anybody lurking near him&mdash;has
he any suspicion&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sir,&#8217; answered the doctor, &#8216;at the present
moment his mind has but half an eye
open.&#8217;</p>

<p>I made one of the crowd that had assembled
to hear the doctor&#8217;s report, and stood
near the binnacle stand&mdash;close enough to it,
in fact, to be able to lay my hand upon the
hood. My eye was travelling from the ugly
patch that had an appearance as of still sifting
out upon the white plank within half a
yard of me, when I caught sight of a black
lump of something just showing in the curve
of the base of the binnacle stand betwixt the
starboard legs of it. It was gone in a moment
with the slipping off it of the streak of moonshine
that had disclosed it to me. Almost
mechanically, whilst I continued to listen to
the doctor, I put my toe to the thing; then,
still in a mechanical way, picked it up. It
was a large stone, something of the shape of
a comb, with a twist in the middle of it, and
of a smooth surface on top, but rugged and
broken underneath, with a length of about
five inches jagged into an edge as keen as a
flint splinter. It was extraordinarily heavy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and might in that quality have been a lump
of gold.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hallo!&#8217; I cried, &#8216;what have we here?&#8217;
and I held it to the glass of the binnacle to
view it by the lamplight.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is that you are looking at, Mr.
Dugdale?&#8217; called out old Keeling.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why,&#8217; said I, &#8216;neither more nor less to
my mind than the weapon with which your
sailor has been laid low, captain.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a rush to look at it. Keeling
held it up to the moonlight, then poised it in
his hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who could have been the ruffian that
hove it?&#8217; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Allow me to see it,&#8217; exclaimed little Mr.
Saunders, and he worked his way, low down
amongst us, to the captain. He weighed the
stone, smelt it, carefully inspected it, then
looked up to the captain with a grin that
wrinkled his large, long, eager, wise old face
from his brow to his chin. &#8216;A suspicion,&#8217; he
exclaimed, &#8216;that has been slowly growing in
my mind is now confirmed. No mortal hand
hove this missile, captain. It comes from the
angels, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>He paused.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>&#8216;Lawk-a-daisy, what is the man going to
say next?&#8217; cried out Mrs. Hudson hysterically.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Keeling, ladies and gentlemen,&#8217;
continued little Saunders, nursing the stone as
tenderly while he spoke as if it had been a
new-born babe, &#8216;this has fallen from those
infinite spangled heights up there. It is, in
short, a meteorolite, and, so far as I can now
judge, a very beautiful specimen of one.&#8217;</p>

<small>THE HUMOURS OF AN INDIAMAN</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> mystery being at an end, most of the
passengers, after a brief spell of loitering and
talking, went below, little Saunders leading the
way with the meteorolite, and the captain
closing the procession, to finish the glass of
grog; he had been disturbed at by finding the
ship off her course. I was exchanging a few
words with Mr. Cocker on this second queer
incident of the day, when the fellow who was
at the wheel exclaimed: &#8216;Beg pardon, sir;&#8217;
and I saw him shift very uneasily from one
leg to the other with a drag of the length of
his arm over his brow, as though he freely
perspired.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it?&#8217; inquired Mr. Cocker.</p>

<p>&#8216;Am I expected to stand here alone, sir?&#8217;
asked the fellow.</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly. What! On a fine night like
this? What do you want? That I should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
call hands to the relieving tackles?&#8217; cried the
second-mate.</p>

<p>The man sent a look up at the stars before
answering, with a sort of cowering air in the
posture of his head.</p>

<p>&#8216;One of them blooming boomerangs,&#8217; said
he, &#8216;might come along again, sir. What&#8217;s a
man to do if time ain&#8217;t allowed him to get out
of the road?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Your having a companion won&#8217;t help you,&#8217;
said the second-mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;I dunno,&#8217; answered the fellow. &#8216;Whatever
it be that chucks the like of them things, might
hold off at the sight of <i>two</i> of us.&#8217;</p>

<p>The second-mate stood looking at him a
little, and then burst into a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, well!&#8217; said he; &#8216;if there&#8217;s ever a
lead-line to sound the depths of forecastle
ignorance, I allow there must be fathoms
enough of it to belay an end to the moon&#8217;s
horns.&#8217;</p>

<p>Nevertheless he called to one of the watch
to come aft and hold the wheel with the other
man, making some allowance, I daresay, for
the superstitious feelings which possessed the
sailor, and which were certainly not to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
softened down by the sight of the great bloodstain
close to his feet.</p>

<p>I went below for a glass of brandy, and
found the passengers listening to Mr. Saunders,
who, with the meteorolite before him, was
delivering a discourse on that kind of stone,
pointing to it with his finger, speaking very
slowly and emphatically, and looking in his
wistful way up into the faces of his audience.
Even Miss Temple seemed interested, and stood
listening with her back against the mizzen-mast,
the embellished trunk of which formed
a very noble fanciful background for her fine
figure. However, I was more in the temper
for a pipe of tobacco than for a lecture, and
was presently on deck again, for after half-past
nine o&#8217;clock in the evening we were privileged
to smoke upon the poop. Colledge presently
joined me; but in twenty minutes he gave a
prodigious yawn and then went to bed; and I
paced the deck alone, with deep enjoyment of
the hush coming to the ship out of the dark
scintillant distance&mdash;a silence of ocean-night
that seemed to be deepened to the senses by
the marble stillness of the wide white pinions
stealing and floating up in a sort of glimmer
of spaces to the faint mist-like square of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
main royal. There was a faint noise of trembling
and rippling waters over the side, and the
line of the taffrail with the two fellows at the
wheel rose and fell very softly to the black
secret heave of the long deep-sea undulation.
The cuddy lamps were dimmed, the interior
deserted; there was a small group of smokers
on the quarter-deck in the shadow of the bulwark
conversing quietly; abaft the mizzen
rigging flitted the dusky form of old Keeling,
who had come up to take a turn or two and a
final squint at the weather before turning in.</p>

<p>Some one emerged through the companion
hatch, and, after looking about him a little,
crossed to the lee rail, where I was standing.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that you, Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I. &#8216;What&#8217;s the matter, Greenhew?
Time to be in bed, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I say, Dugdale,&#8217; exclaimed the young
fellow in a breathless kind of way, as though
the effort to check some fit of merriment nearly
choked him, &#8216;there&#8217;s such a lark down-stairs&mdash;in
my cabin&mdash;Riley, you know&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; And
here he laughed out.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the lark?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;I want you to come and see,&#8217; he answered.
&#8216;I found it out by the merest accident. Heavens,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
what capers! And if I don&#8217;t contrive some
excuse to introduce Miss Hudson into the cabin,
that she may see him&mdash;&mdash; Well! well! But
come along, though.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But, my good fellow, let me first of all
know what I am to see,&#8217; said I. &#8216;I am enjoying
the silence and coolness of this deck and
my pipe and&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He interrupted me as he cautiously stared
around him.</p>

<p>&#8216;You know, of course, that Riley&#8217;s got the
bunk under me?&#8217; he exclaimed in a fluttering
voice, as though he should at any moment
break out into a loud laugh; &#8216;well, you can
make him do whatever you like when he&#8217;s
asleep.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Go on,&#8217; said I; &#8216;I may understand you
presently.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When I went to my cabin to turn in,&#8217; he
continued, &#8216;I found him in bed; and imagining
him to be awake, I exclaimed, just as a
matter of chaff, you know: &#8220;Look out, my
friend! There&#8217;ll be a meteorolite crashing
clean through my bunk into your head in a
minute&mdash;so, mind your eye, Riley!&#8221; The
moment I said this he hopped out from between
his sheets on to the deck, and stood cowering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
with his hands over his head, as if to shelter
it. His eyes were shut, and I supposed he was
playing the fool. &#8220;Get back into bed, man,&#8221;
said I; &#8220;you can&#8217;t humbug me.&#8221; He immediately
lay down again in a manner that surprised
me, I assure you, Dugdale; for it was as full
of obedience as the behaviour of any beaten
dog. I watched him a little, to see if he
opened his eyes; but he kept them shut, and
his breathing proved him fast asleep. I
thought I would try him again. &#8220;Hi, Riley!&#8221;
I exclaimed. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Peter Hemskirk come
to haul you out of your bunk. Protect yourself,
or he&#8217;ll be dragging you into the cuddy,
dressed as you are, and Miss Hudson is there
to see you.&#8221; Instantly, Dugdale&#8217;&mdash;here he
clapped his hands to his lips, to smother a fit
of laughter&mdash;&#8216;he doubled up his fists and let
fly at the air, kicking off the clothes, that he
might strike out with his legs; and thus he lay
working all over like a galvanised frog. You
never saw such a sight. Come down and look
at him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you observed anything of the sort
in him before?&#8217; said I, knocking the ashes out
of my pipe.</p>

<p>&#8216;Never before,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;but I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
him on the hip now. He&#8217;s tried to make a
fool of me to Miss Hudson, and this blessed
evening shows me my way to a very pretty
rejoinder. Come along, come along! Should
he wake, there can be no performance.&#8217;</p>

<p>He went gliding with the step of a skater
to the companion, and I followed, scarcely
knowing as yet whether the young fellow was
not designing in all this some practical joke
of which I was to be the victim. We passed
through the deserted cuddy, faintly lighted by
one dimly burning lantern, and descended to
the lower deck, where the corridor between
the berths was illuminated by a bull&#8217;s-eye
lamp fixed under a clock against the bulkhead.
The cabin shared by the young men
stood three doors down past mine on the same
side of the ship. Greenhew halted a moment
to listen, then turned the handle, took a peep,
and beckoned me to enter. Affixed to a
stanchion was a small bracket lamp, the glow
of which was upon Riley&#8217;s face as he lay on
his back in an under bunk, unmistakably in a
deep sleep. His eyes were sealed, his lips
parted, his respirations low and deep, as of
one who slumbers heavily. The wild disorder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
of the bedclothes was corroboration enough
of Greenhew&#8217;s tale, at least in one article
of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Try him yourself,&#8217; said my companion in
a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;I have a sailor&#8217;s
reverence for sleep. You have invited me
here to witness a performance. It is for you
to make the play, Greenhew.&#8217;</p>

<p>He at once cried out: &#8216;Riley! Riley! the
ship is sinking! For God&#8217;s sake strike out, or
you&#8217;re a drowned man!&#8217;</p>

<p>I was amazed to observe the young fellow
instantly rise to his knees and motion with his
arms in the exact manner of a swimmer, yet
with a stoop of the head to clear it of the
boards of the upper bunk, which I considered
as remarkable as any other part of the extraordinary
exhibition for the perception that it
indicated of surrounding conditions; whilst
his gestures on the other hand proved him
completely under the control of the delusion
created by his cabin-fellow&#8217;s cry. I also observed
an expression of extreme suffering and
anxiety in his face, that was made dumb
otherwise by the closed lids. In fact it was
the countenance of a swimmer battling in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
agony. Greenhew looked on half choking
with laughter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; he whipped out in disjointed syllables,
&#8216;if Miss Hudson could only see him now!
Dugdale, you&#8217;ll have to find me some excuse
to introduce her here. Her mother must
attend too&mdash;the more the merrier!&#8217; and here
he went off again into a fit, as though he
should suffocate.</p>

<p>For my part, I could see nothing to laugh
at. Indeed, the thing shocked and astonished
me as a painful, degrading, mysterious expression
of the human mind acting under
conditions of which I could not be expected
of course to make head or tail. Riley continued
to move his arms with the motions of
a swimmer for some minutes, meanwhile
breathing hard, as though the water&#8217;s edge
rose to his lip, whilst his face continued drawn
out into an indescribable expression of distress.
His gesticulations then grew feeble, his respiration
lost its fierceness and swiftness and
became once more long drawn and regular,
and presently he lay back, still in a deep sleep,
in the posture in which I had observed him
when I entered.</p>

<p>&#8216;What d&#8217;ye think of <i>that</i>?&#8217; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Greenhew with a face of triumphant enjoyment.</p>

<p>&#8216;A pitiful trick for a sleeper to fall into,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;I like your show so little, Greenhew,
that I wish to see no more of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, nonsense!&#8217; he exclaimed; &#8216;let&#8217;s keep
him caper-cutting a while longer. I&#8217;ll have a
regular performance here every night. It
shall be the talk of the ship, by George!&#8217;</p>

<p>As he spoke these words, Riley uttered a
low cry, opened his eyes full upon us, stared
a moment with the bewilderment of a man
who has not all his senses, then sat upright,
running his gaze over his bedclothes.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is the matter?&#8217; he exclaimed, looking
around at us. &#8216;Who has been&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The light and expression of a full mind
entered his eyes. He threw his feet over on
to the deck and stood up.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have I been making a fool of myself in
my sleep, Dugdale?&#8217; said he.&mdash;I was at a loss
for an answer.&mdash;He proceeded: &#8216;I know my
weakness. I have heard of it often enough&mdash;at
school&mdash;from my mother&mdash;again and again
since, Dugdale. Greenhew has brought you
here to watch me. And that means,&#8217; cried he,
turning fiercely upon Greenhew, &#8216;that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
have been exercising your humour upon me
in my sleep, and instead of compassionating
a painful and humiliating infirmity, you
have&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>His temper choked him. He clenched his
fist and let fly at friend Greenhew right between
the eyes. Down went the Civil Service
man like a statue knocked off its pedestal;
but he was up again in a minute; and neither
of them wanting in spunk, at it they went!
It was enough to make any man die of laughter
to see Riley&#8217;s very imperfectly clad figure
dancing and man&#339;uvring round Greenhew
with the gestures of a cannibal at a feast-dance,
yet all the while handsomely plumping
his fists into his antagonist, who hammered
wildly in return with a ruddy nose and one
eye already slowly closing. I threw myself
between them, but could do little for laughing.
They fought in silence, so far at least as their
voices were concerned; but the hard thumps
they dealt the bulkhead as they went pommelling
each other from side to side, not to
mention their frequent capsizals over boxes,
the flight of any objects, such as boots, which
their toes happened to strike against, might
well have caused the occupants of the adjacent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
cabins to believe that if this scramble did
not signify a rush of people escaping from a
sinking ship, then it must certainly mean a
desperate mutiny amongst the crew accompanied
by all the disorder of a struggle for
life.</p>

<p>&#8216;For heaven&#8217;s sake, stop this!&#8217; I shouted;
&#8216;consider how terrified the ladies will be.
Greenhew, cease it, man. Riley, get you into
your bunk again&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Here there was a violent thumping upon
the door of the cabin.</p>

<p>&#8216;Anybody fallen mad here?&#8217; was bawled
in the familiar notes of Colonel Bannister,
&#8216;or is it murder that&#8217;s being done?&#8217;</p>

<p>He opened the door and looked in.</p>

<p>&#8216;Vot, in Got&#8217;s name, iss happening?&#8217;
rumbled the deep voice of Peter Hemskirk
over the military man&#8217;s shoulder.</p>

<p>The ship slightly leaned at that moment,
and caused the Dutchman to put his weight
against the colonel, with the consequence
that the little soldier was shot into the cabin
with Mynheer at his heels.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s this?&#8217; cried the colonel.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll teach you!&#8217; gasped Riley.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>&#8216;Haven&#8217;t you had enough?&#8217; shouted Greenhew.</p>

<p>&#8216;Seberate &#8217;em! seberate &#8217;em!&#8217; exclaimed
Hemskirk. &#8216;Look, shentlemen, how Mr.
Greenhew bleeds.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What on earth is the matter?&#8217; exclaimed
some one at the door.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Emmett. He trembled, and
was very pale. He had thrown his tragedian
cloak over his shoulders, and looked a truly
ludicrous object with a short space of his
bare shanks showing and his feet in a pair of
large carpet slippers. In fact, by this time
the whole of the passengers were alarmed,
the ladies looking out of their doors and
calling, the men hustling into the passage to
see, with the sound of Mr. Prance&#8217;s voice at
the head of the steps of the hatch shouting
down to know what the noise was about. It
was more than I could stand. The figures
of the colonel and the Dutchman and Emmett,
not to mention Riley, coming on top of the
absurdity of the fight, proved too much for
me. I took one look at Greenhew, shot
through the door, gained my cabin, and
flung myself into my bunk, exhausted with
laughter, and utterly incapable of answering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the numberless questions which Colledge fired
off at me.</p>

<p>The noise ceased after a while, but not
before I heard the captain&#8217;s storming accents
outside my berth. I could also hear the
colonel complaining in strong language of so
great an outrage as that of two young men
fighting in the dead of night within the
hearing of ladies. The old skipper insisted
on one of the young fellows quitting the
cabin and sharing the berth tenanted by Mr.
Fairthorne. Both vehemently refused to
budge. The captain then asked who struck
the first blow. Riley answered that he had,
and was beginning to explain, when old Keeling
silenced him by saying that he would
give him five minutes to retire to Mr. Fairthorne&#8217;s
berth, and that if he had not cleared
out by that time he would send for the boatswain
and a sailor or two to show him the
road. This ended the difficulty, as I was
told next morning, and the rest of the night
passed quietly enough.</p>

<p>Next day, Mr. Riley put in an appearance
at breakfast. On seeing me he came round
to my seat, and in a few words begged me
not to explain the cause of the quarrel, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
had no wish that his peculiarity as a sleeper
should be known to the rest of us. I gave
him my word, but regretted that he should
have exacted it, as I wished to talk
with Saunders and Hemmeridge on the
very extraordinary manifestations I had witnessed.
It was fortunate, however, that my
share in the disturbance was not guessed at.
The colonel, Hemskirk, and the rest imagined
that I had been drawn to the young men&#8217;s
berth by the noise, as they had, and no questions
were therefore asked me. Mr. Greenhew
kept his bed for three days. It was
mainly sulking and shame with him, the
others thought; but the truth was his eye
had not only closed, but was so swollen and
blackened as to render him unfit to appear in
public. He sent one of the stewards to ask
me to see him; but I had had quite enough
of Mr. Greenhew, and contrived to keep clear
of the youth until his coming on deck made
escape from him impossible.</p>

<p>Nothing happened worth noting in the
week that followed this business. The trade-wind
blew as languid a breeze as ever vexed
the heart and inflamed the passions of a ship-master.
It was to be a long passage, we all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
said&mdash;six months, Mr. Johnson predicted&mdash;and
old Keeling admitted that he had nothing
to offer us in the way of hope until we had
crossed the equator, where the south-east
trades might compensate us for this northern
sluggishness by blowing a brisk gale of wind.</p>

<p>However, if the dull crawling of the ship
held the spirits of us who lived aft somewhat
low, forward the Jacks made sport enough
for themselves, and of a second dog-watch
were as jolly a lot as ever fetched an echo
out of a hollow topsail with salt-hardened
lungs. There were a couple of excellent
fiddlers amongst them, and these chaps
would perch themselves upon the booms, and
with bowed heads and quivering arms saw
endless dance-tunes out of the catgut. Many
a half-hour have I pleasantly killed in watching
and hearkening to the forecastle frolics.
The squeaking of the fiddles was the right
sort of music for the show; the Jacks in
couples lovingly embracing each other, slided,
twirled, frisked, polked with loose delighted
limbs between the forecastle rails, their hairy
faces grinning over each other&#8217;s shoulders;
or one of them would take the deck&mdash;the
rest drawing off to smoke a pipe and look on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
&mdash;and break into a noble maritime shuffle&mdash;the
true deep-sea hornpipe&mdash;always dancing
it to perfection, as I would think. One such
scene I vividly recall as I sit writing: a tar
of manly proportions, a little way past the
forecastle ladder, plain in the view of the
poop, his shoes twinkling, his flowing duck
breeches trembling, his arms folded, or one
hand gracefully arching to his head, his
straw hat on nine hairs, his face between
his broad black whiskers showing out in the
hue of claret, his little eyes sparkling with
the enjoyment of the measures, and the
perspiration hopping off his nose like parched
peas; past him a crowd of storm-dyed faces
meditatively surveying him, gnawing with
excitement upon the junks standing high in
their cheeks in their sympathy with the
dancer, or pulling their pipes from their lips
with the slow deliberateness of the merchant
sailor to expectorate and growl out a comment
upon the capering lively; to the right
of him amidships on the booms the two
fiddlers, working their hardest, and threatening
every moment to topple over on to the
deck with the energy of their movements.
Far ahead forked out the great bowsprit and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
jib-booms, made massive to the eye by the
long spritsail yard and the enormously thick
gear of shrouds and guys; on high rose the
canvas at the fore, yellowing as it soared into
a golden tinge to the westering glory that
was setting the heavens on fire on the starboard
beam. Oh! it was a sight beautiful
exceedingly, with the gilding of the ropes by
the sunset to the complexion of golden wire,
and a long line of blood-red radiance flowing
down to the ship from the horizon, and making
a sparkling scarlet of the fabric&#8217;s glossy
sides, and putting a crimson star of splendour
into every window, with the sweep of the
dark-blue sea coursing in long lines into the
east, that showed in a liquid softness of violet
past the wan spaces of the far overhanging
studdingsails.</p>

<p>In this same week about which I am
writing, Mr. Colledge, inspired possibly by the
noise of the fiddles forward and the spectacle
of the forecastle jinks, made an effort to get
up a dance aft; but to no purpose. Some of
the girls looked eagerly when the thing was
suggested; and certainly Colledge&#8217;s programme
was a promising one: there was the
wide spread of awning for a ballroom ceiling;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
there were flags in abundance to stretch between
the ridge-rope and the rail, as a wall of
radiant colours through which the moon
would sift her delicate tender haze without
injury to the light of the lanterns, which were
to be hung in a row on either side fore and
aft; there was the piano to rouse up from its
moorings below, and to be secured on some
part of the deck where its tinkling could be
everywhere heard. There was also a quiet
sea, and a deck whose gentle cradling could
but serve as a pulse to the joyous revolutions
of the waltz.</p>

<p>Colledge was enchanted with his scheme,
and went about thirstily in the prosecution of
it; but, as I have said, to no purpose. Colonel
Bannister shouted with derision when asked if
he would dance; Greenhew was not yet well
of his eye, was extremely sulky, and hung
about in retired places; Riley called dancing
a bore; Fairthorne pleaded tender feet; little
Saunders smote his breast to Colledge&#8217;s inquiry
and said plaintively: &#8216;Who would stand up
with <i>me</i>?&#8217; In short, every man-jack of us
aft, saving Mr. Johnson and myself, declined
to take any active part in the proposed ball;
and Colledge, with a face of loathing, abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the idea, vowing to me that he had
never met with such a pack of scarecrows in
his life, and that we should have been better
off in the direction of jollity and companionship
had the cargo of monkeys been spared
to take the place of our male passengers.</p>

<p>Thus did we somewhat wearily roll our
way through the Atlantic parallels, fanned by
a light north-east wind over the quarter, under
a heaven of blue, with the sun in the midst of
it splendidly shining, and a night-sky of airy
indigo rich with stars from sea-line to sea-line.
The flying-fish shot from the coppered
sides of the Indiaman, but saving them and
ourselves, the ocean was tenantless of life; we
sighted no ship; no bird hovered near us;
once only, when it was drawing near to midnight,
I heard the sounds of a deep respiration
off one or the other of the bows&mdash;the noise of
some leviathan of the deep rising from the
dark profound to blow his fountain under the
stars; but there was no shadow of it to be
seen nor break of white waters to indicate its
neighbourhood. It was but a single sigh,
deep and solemn, as though old ocean himself
had delivered it out of his heart, and the
glittering heights seemed to gather a deeper
mystery from the mere note of it.</p>

<small>A STRANGE SAIL</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a Friday morning. On going on deck
before breakfast for a pump-bath in the ship&#8217;s
head, I found as queer a look of weather all
about as ever I had witnessed in my life. A
troubled swell, but without much height or
power, was running from the westwards, and
the Indiaman rolled awkwardly upon it with
much noise of beating canvas aloft and of
straining spars. The water was of a dull
olive tint, with an appearance of mud in it,
as though some violent disturbance at
bottom had lifted the ooze cloudily to the
surface. It was hard to tell whether the sky
was blue or slate, so thick, dusty, impervious
was it, with here and there a dim outline of
cloud, and patches, so to speak, of a kind of
yellowish blue, where some belly of obscured
vapour stooped lower than the rest; whilst,
the whole sea-circle round, there hovered an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
immense grummet or ring of a dingy, sooty
appearance, like to a line of smoke left by the
funnels of steamers, and hanging in a brown
cloud, leagues in length, in silent motionless
weather on the rim of the waters of the
English Channel.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hallo, Mr. Smallridge,&#8217; said I, as I stepped
over the rail out of the head, addressing the
boatswain, who was superintending the work
of a couple of hands slung over the bow,
&#8216;what have we yonder?&#8217; and I sent my gaze
at a sail I had now for the first time caught
sight of that was hovering down upon our
port quarter some two or three miles distant.</p>

<p>&#8216;A brig, sir, I believe,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;she
was in sight much about the same place at
daybreak. There&#8217;s been a little air of wind,
but it&#8217;s failing, I doubt.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Making way for something to follow, I
fancy?&#8217; said I, casting a look round the
horizon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;that muck&#8217;s a-drawing
up, and there&#8217;ll be thunder in it too, if my
corns speaks right. Niver had no such aching
in my toes as this morning since last Toosday
was two year, when we fell in off the Hope
with the ugliest thunderstorm that I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
remember south of the heequator. When
my corns begins to squirm I always know
that thunder ain&#8217;t fur off.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, thunder or no thunder,&#8217; said I, &#8216;I
hope there&#8217;s to come wind enough in the wake
of all this to blow us along. We shall be
having to call it sixty days to the Line, bo&#8217;sun,
if we don&#8217;t mind our eye;&#8217; and giving him a
friendly nod, I made my way to my cabin to
finish dressing.</p>

<p>The gloomy appearance continued all the
morning without the least change. The wind
fell dead; and a prodigious hush overhung
the sea, a stillness that grew absolutely overwhelming
to the fancy, if you gave your mind
to it, and stood watching the heave of the
swell running in ugly green heaps without a
sound. Noises were curiously distinct. The
voice of a man hailing the forecastle from the
foretopmast cross-trees sounded on the poop
as though he had called from the maintop.
A laugh from near the wheel had a startlingly
near note, though it came to you along the
whole length of the after-deck. The water
brimming to the channels alongside to the
stoop of the hull sent the oddest hollowest
sobbing tone into the air, as though some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
monster were strangling alongside. Halliards
had been let go and sails clewed up and
hauled down, and the <i>Countess Ida</i> lay with
something of a naked look as she wallowed
with the clumsiness of a wide-beamed ship
under topsails and fore course; and all the
rest of the square canvas, saving the royals
and mizzen topgallant-sail, which were furled,
swinging in and out festooned by the grip of
the gear.</p>

<p>By noon the sail that I had noticed early
that morning had neared us in some insensible
fashion till she hung something more than a
mile away off the quarter as before. I had
several times examined her with the telescope
and was not a little impressed by her appearance.
She was a brig of about two hundred
and sixty tons; a most beautiful and perfect
model, indeed, with a clipper lift of bow and
a knife-like cutwater and a long wonderfully
graceful arching sweep of side rounding into
the very perfection of a run. Her copper
came high, and was very clean, as though she
were fresh from port. Her masts were singularly
lofty for her size, both of them tapering
away into skysail poles with yards across;
but she had furled all canvas down to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
two topsails and foresail, and lay rolling
heavily, lifting her symmetrical fabric to the
height of the swell, when she would be hove
out against the ugly sulky background in
such keen relief that her rigging glanced like
hairs as it came from the mastheads to the
channels, with a white, odd, almost ghastly
stare in her canvas that was brilliant as cotton;
then down she would sink behind some sullen
almost livid peak till she was hidden to the
reef-band of her fore-course.</p>

<p>Throughout the morning I had observed
Captain Keeling somewhat restlessly examining
her; that is to say, he would send looks
enough at her through his binocular glass to
suggest that he found something unusual,
perhaps disturbing, in her appearance. There
were no sights to be had, though the old
fellow and his two mates stood about the
deck, sextants in hands, occasionally lifting
their eyes to that part of the sky where the
sun was supposed to be. Observing Mr.
Prance at the rail, steadfastly observing the
brig down upon the quarter, I went up to him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pray what do you find in that craft yonder,
Mr. Prance, to interest you? The skipper
does not seem able to keep his glass off her.&#8217;</p>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>&#8216;What do <i>you</i> see, Mr. Dugdale?&#8217; he
answered, viewing me out of the corners of his
eyes without turning his head. &#8216;Come, you
have been a sailor. What is <i>your</i> notion of
her?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s a beauty, anyway,&#8217; I answered; &#8216;no
builder&#8217;s yard ever turned out anything
sweeter in the shape of a hull&mdash;a trifle too
lofty, perhaps. For my part, I hate everything
above royals. Give me short mastheads, the
royal-yard sitting close under the track,
English frigate-fashion&#8217;&mdash;I was proceeding.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, no; I don&#8217;t mean that, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217;
he interrupted with a hint of a seaman&#8217;s
impatience at my criticism.</p>

<p>&#8216;What, then?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Does she look honest, think you?&#8217; said
he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; cried I: &#8216;now I understand.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush! not a word if you please,&#8217; he
exclaimed with a glance along the poop; &#8216;the
ladies must on no account be frightened, and
it is but a mere suspicion on Captain Keeling&#8217;s
part at best. Yet he has had some acquaintance
with gentry of her kind, if, indeed, yonder
chap be of the denomination he conjectures.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She must have been stealthily sneaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
down upon us,&#8217; I exclaimed, &#8216;to occupy her
present position, otherwise she should be a
league distant out on the beam. But then
such a hull as that must yield to a catspaw
that wouldn&#8217;t blow a feather out of the
<i>Countess Ida&#8217;s</i> mizzen-top. What has been
seen to excite misgiving, Mr. Prance?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Too many of a crew, sir,&#8217; he answered;
&#8216;the outline of a long-tom on her forecastle,
but ill-concealed by the raffle thrown over it.
Six guns of a side, Mr. Dugdale, though the
closed ports hide their grins.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She will not attempt anything with a big
chap like us, surely.&#8217;</p>

<p>At that moment the captain called him, and
he walked aft.</p>

<p>Presently, it sensibly darkened, as though
to the passage of some denser sheet of vapour
crawling through the heart of the obscurity
on high. The sea turned of an oil-like smoothness,
and ran in folds as of liquid bottle-green
glass out of the grimy shadow that was slowly
thickening all away round the ocean limit.
The order was given to furl the clewed-up sails
and to reef the topsails. The boatswain&#8217;s pipe
summoned all hands to this work, and the ship
for a while was full of life and commotion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
However, by this time the secret of old
Keeling&#8217;s uneasiness had in some way leaked
out; in fact, the skipper could no longer have
kept the people in ignorance of his suspicions;
for some ten minutes or so before the tiffin
bell rang, after the hands had come down
from aloft, the order was quietly sent along to
see all clear for action; and as I took my seat
at table, being close to the cuddy front, as my
chair brought me with a clear view of the
quarter-deck through the open windows, I
could observe the men preparing our little show
of carronades, removing the tompions, placing
rams, sponges, train-tackles, and the like at
hand, and passing shot and chests of small-arms
through the main hatch.</p>

<p>Captain Keeling, stiff, and bolstered up as
usual in his brass-buttoned frock coat, his face
of a deeper rubicund from some recent touch
of soap and towel, seated himself at the head
of the table; but Prance and the other mates
remained on deck. One noticed a deal of uneasiness
amongst the ladies, saving Miss Temple
whose haughty beautiful face wore its ordinary
impassive expression. There was no coquetry
in the startled eyes that Miss Hudson rolled
around. Mrs. Bannister fanned herself vehemently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
and ate nothing. There were some
of us males, too, who looked as if we didn&#8217;t
like it. Mr. Emmett was exceedingly thoughtful;
Mr. Fairthorne drank thirstily, and pulled
incessantly at his little sprouting moustache;
Mr. Hodder watched old Keeling continuously;
and Mr. Riley made much of his eye-glass.
Nothing to the point was said for a little while;
then the colonel rapped out:</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, captain, have you any notion as to
the nationality of that chap whom your people
are making ready to resist?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir,&#8217; answered Keeling stiffly; &#8216;we
gave her a sight of our ensign this morning;
but she showed no colours in return, and I
am not a man to keep my hat off to one who
will not respond.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dot iss my vay,&#8217; exclaimed Peter Hemskirk,
bestowing a train of nods on the skipper.</p>

<p>&#8216;But, captain,&#8217; said Mrs. Joliffe, a nervous
gentle-faced middle-aged lady, with soft white
hair, &#8216;have you any good reason for supposing
that the ship may prove dangerous to us?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Madam,&#8217; responded Keeling with a bow,
and you noticed the prevailing condition
amongst us by the general nervous inclining
of ears towards the old fellow to catch what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
he said, &#8216;there is reason to believe that certain
Spaniards of the island of Cuba have equipped
two or three smart vessels to act the part of
marine highwaymen. The authorities wink at
the business, I am told. Their practice is to
bring ships to and board them, and plunder
the best of what they may come across. Last
year, a West Indiaman named the <i>Jamaica
Belle</i> was overhauled by one of these craft,
who took specie amounting to twelve thousand
pounds out of her. I believe they are not cut-throats
in the old piratic sense.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, don&#8217;t speak of cut-throats!&#8217; cried
Mrs. Hudson. &#8216;Will they dare to attack us&mdash;the
monsters!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ladies and gentlemen,&#8217; said Keeling,
&#8216;pray, clearly understand: my suspicions of
the stranger may be ill-founded. Meanwhile,
our business is to put ourselves in a posture of
defence, ready for whatever may happen.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly,&#8217; exclaimed the colonel very
emphatically with a look round; and then
speaking with his eyes fixed upon Mr. Johnson;
&#8216;I presume we shall be able to count upon all
our male friends here assembled to assist your
crew to the utmost of their powers, should the
stranger make any attempt upon this ship?&#8217;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>&#8216;We shall expect you to cover yourself
with glory, colonel,&#8217; said Mr. Johnson, in a
familiar sarcastic voice; &#8216;and I shall be happy
to write and print a full description of your
behaviour, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am quite willing to fight,&#8217; exclaimed
Mr. Fairthorne in an effeminate voice. &#8216;I
mean that I shall be glad to thoot; but I am
no thwordthman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Possengers hov no beesness to vight,&#8217; exclaimed
Mynheer Hemskirk, enlarging his immense
waistcoat by obtruding his chest; &#8216;dey
gets in der vay of dem as knows vot to do.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple bit her lip to conceal a smile.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s all very well,&#8217; exclaimed Riley,
talking at Miss Hudson; &#8216;but suppose, Hemskirk,
you should find some greasy Spaniard
with earrings and oily ringlets rifling your
boxes, hauling out all the money you&#8217;ve got,
pocketing that fine silver-mounted meerschaum
pipe of yours&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I vould coot orff hiss head,&#8217; answered the
Dutchman, breathing hard.</p>

<p>&#8216;Gentlemen, you are unnecessarily alarming
the ladies,&#8217; cried old marline-spike from the
head of the table.</p>

<p>&#8216;I suppose there&#8217;s no lack of small-arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
with you, captain?&#8217; roared the Colonel;
&#8216;plenty for us here as well as for your
men?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall insist upon your not meddling,
Edward, in whatever may happen,&#8217; cried his
wife, giving him an emphatic nod over the
edge of her fan with her Roman nose.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shall meddle, then, my dear,&#8217; he shouted.
&#8216;If it comes to those rascals attacking us, I
shall fight, as of course we all will,&#8217; and again
he bent his little fiery eyes upon Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p>&#8216;My note-book is ready, colonel,&#8217; said
Mr. Johnson pleasantly, with a satirical grin
at the peppery little soldier. &#8216;I&#8217;ll not lose
sight of you, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe you will then, sir,&#8217; sneered the
colonel, &#8216;unless Captain Keeling takes the
precaution to clap his hatches on to prevent
anybody skulking below from off the deck.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mere bluster is not going to help us,&#8217;
said Colledge, who disliked the colonel; &#8216;no
good in railing and storming like heroes in a
blank-verse performance for an hour at a
time before falling to. If Captain Keeling
wants any assistance outside that of his crew,
he may command me for one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wath never taught fenthing,&#8217; said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Mr. Fairthorne; &#8216;if I fight, it mutht be with
a muthket.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If the ship should be captured, what&#8217;s to
become of us?&#8217; cried Mrs. Hudson. &#8216;I&#8217;ve
read the most barbarous histories about
pirates. They have no respect for sex or
age; and it&#8217;s quite common, I&#8217;ve heard, for
every pirate to have twelve wives.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here Mrs. Trevor suddenly shrieked out
for some one to bring her baby to her, then
went into hysterics, and was presently carried
away in a dead faint by the stewards, followed
by her daughter, weeping bitterly. Old
Keeling whipped out an oath.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, gentlemen,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;you see
what your conversation has brought about.
Ladies, I beg that you will not be uneasy.
The stranger will give us no trouble, I am
persuaded;&#8217; and rising with a look of contempt,
he bowed stiffly to Miss Temple and
her aunt, and went on deck.</p>

<p>I was too curious to observe what was
going forward to linger in the cuddy amid
this idle rattle of tongues. Our ship having
no steerage-way, had slewed to the beat of the
swell, and the brig was now off the starboard
bow, pretty much distant as she had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
when we went to lunch, but showing out with
amazing clearness against the sooty sky past
her, upon which her topsails swung from side to
side so heavily that the lower yard-arms at times
seemed to spear the water lifting to them in
hills. All over and beyond her lay a deep
shadow of thunder, a sky scowling to the
zenith thick as though viewed through a dust-storm,
with a vision of the tufted cloud of the
electric tempest hovering here and there; but
there was no lightning as yet, no echo of distant
grumbling; there was not a breath of
air to cool the moistened lip, and the noiseless
heave of the swell was as though old ocean
lay breathing hard in a posture of dumb expectation.</p>

<p>Our crew hung about the decks in groups
ready to spring to the first command. Iron
stanchions had been fitted into the line of the
rails, and boarding-nets triced up the length
of the ship from just before the fore-rigging
to the poop rail. Aft was a small gang of
seamen stationed at each gun there, with all
necessary machinery for the artillery at hand.
The captain, the chief mate, and Mr. Cocker
stood abreast of the wheel, looking at the
brig with an occasional glance round the sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
at the weather. I stepped to the side to take
another view of the stranger, and I was
noticing with admiration the toy-like beauty
of her as she soared with ruddy sheathing to
the head of a swell, with now and again a most
delicate echo of the clapping and beating of
her canvas stealing to us through the dark,
breathless atmosphere, when I was accosted
by some one at my elbow.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you think it possible, Mr. Dugdale,
that if that vessel fired at our ship she could
hit us, so violently rolling as she is?&#8217;</p>

<p>I turned. It was Mrs. Radcliffe, and with
her was Miss Temple. With the exception of
a &#8216;good morning&#8217; or a &#8216;good night,&#8217; I had
never exchanged a syllable with this lady in
all the time she and I had been together on
shipboard. Her kind little face fluttered
jerkily at me as she asked the question in a
manner to remind one of the movements of
the head of a hen. Miss Temple stood like a
statue, swaying to the majestic perpendicular
of her figure upon the rolling deck without
the least visible effort to keep her balance,
her dark and shining eyes fixed upon the
brig.</p>

<p>&#8216;Her gunners,&#8217; said I, &#8216;would need to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
practised marksmen, I should say, to hit us
from such a tumbling platform as that yonder.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Just my opinion, as I told you, Louise,&#8217; she
exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;If she were to begin to fire,&#8217; exclaimed
the girl, keeping her gaze bent seawards, &#8216;she
would be sure to hit us, though it were by
chance.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very possibly,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;There will be some wind soon, I think,
don&#8217;t you?&#8217; said Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>&#8216;I hope so,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;In that case,&#8217; said she, &#8216;we shall be able
to sail away and escape, shan&#8217;t we?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She will chase us,&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple;
&#8216;and as she sails faster than we do, she
will catch us!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, is that likely?&#8217; cried Mrs. Radcliffe,
with a nervous toss of her head at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Everything is possible at sea,&#8217; said I,
laughing; &#8216;but there is a deal in our favour,
Mrs. Radcliffe: first the weather, that as good
as disables that fellow at present anyway;
then the coming on of the night, with every
prospect of losing the brig in the darkness.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Would you advocate our running away<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
from him?&#8217; exclaimed Miss Temple, looking
at me with a fulness and firmness that was
as embarrassing and vexing in its way as an
impertinent stare.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, yes,&#8217; said I; &#8216;certainly. We are a
peaceful trader. It is our business to arrive
in India sound in body&#8217;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8216;I should consider,&#8217; said she, gazing at me
as if she would subdue me into acquiescence
in anything she chose to say by merely eyeing
me strenuously, &#8216;that Captain Keeling
would be acting the part of a coward if he
ran away from that little vessel.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Louise, how can you talk so!&#8217; cried
Mrs. Radcliffe, with a sort of despairful toss of
her hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should like to see a fight between two
ships,&#8217; said the girl, removing her overbearing
eyes from my face to send them over the deck
amongst the groups of men. &#8216;Of course, if
that vessel attacks us, we ladies will be sent
below to rend the cabin with our screams at
every broadside; but I, for one, am perfectly
willing, if the captain consents, to shoot at
those people through a porthole.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Louise, the whims which possess you
are really dreadful!&#8217; cried Mrs. Radcliffe:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
&#8216;imagine, if you should even wound a man!
it would make you miserable for life; perhaps
end in your becoming a Roman Catholic and
going into a convent. Think of that.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple looked at her aunt with a
little curl of her lip.</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not know,&#8217; she exclaimed, &#8216;why it
should be more dreadful in a woman to defend
her life than in a man. Nobody, I suppose,
wishes to hurt those people; but if they
attempt to hurt us, why should we women
feel shocked at the notion of our helping the
sailors to protect the ship by any means in
our power? I am like Mr. Fairthorne,&#8217; she
continued, with a sarcastic glance at me; &#8216;I
could not fight with a sword, but I can certainly
pull the trigger of a musket.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is really hardly lady-like, my dear,&#8217;
began Mrs. Radcliffe.</p>

<p>&#8216;Nonsense, aunt! Lady-like! Is it more
genteel to fall into hysterics and swoon away,
than to take aim at a wicked wretch who will
have your life if you don&#8217;t take his?&#8217; and as
she said this, she whipped a cotton umbrella
out of her aunt&#8217;s hand, and putting it to her
shoulder, as though it were a gun, levelled it
at the brig.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>Colledge, who was standing at a little distance
away, talking to two or three of the
passengers, clapped his hands and laughed
out. For my part, I could not take my eyes
off her, so fascinating were the beauties of her
fine form in that posture, her head drooped
in the attitude of the marksman, and her
marble-like profile showing out clear as a cutting
in ivory against the soft shadowy mass of
gloom of the sky astern.</p>

<p>Mrs. Radcliffe again tossed her arms in a
despairful gesture, with a pecking, so to speak,
of her face at the gangs of men on the quarter-deck
and waist; and then making a little
flurried snatch at her umbrella, she passed
her arm through her niece&#8217;s, exclaiming:
&#8216;Help me to reach the cuddy, my dear.
There&#8217;s a thunderstorm brewing, I&#8217;m sure,
and I&#8217;m afraid of lightning.&#8217; She made me a
little staggering curtsey, and walked with Miss
Temple to the companion, down which the
pair of them went, followed by Mr. Colledge,
who I could hear complimenting Miss Temple
on her resolution to fight the enemy, if the
stranger should prove one.</p>

<p>A few minutes later Mr. Emmett and Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
Johnson approached me, bumping against
each other like a brace of lighters in a seaway
as they struck out on the swaying deck
with their staggering legs.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, Dugdale,&#8217; cried the journalist,
&#8216;shall you fight?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, yes,&#8217; I answered. &#8216;We shall all be
expected to help the crew certainly.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t see that!&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Emmett,
drawing his wide-awake down to his nose
and folding his arms with a tragic gesture
upon his breast, whilst he swung his figure
from side to side on wide-stretched legs. &#8216;It&#8217;s
all very fine to expect; but I agree with
Johnson, whose argument is, that we have
paid our money to be transported in safety to
Bombay; and I cannot for the life of me see
that the captain has any right to look for cooperation
at our hands, unless, indeed, he so
contrives it as to enable us to help him without
imperilling our lives.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But that fellow yonder may be full of
ruffians, Emmett,&#8217; said I; &#8216;and if you do not
help our sailors to defend the <i>Countess Ida</i>, they
may board us; and then they will cut your
throat,&#8217; I added, with a look at his long neck,
&#8216;which is no very agreeable sensation, I believe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and an experience quite worth a pinch of
heroism to evade.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a beastly business altogether,&#8217; said he,
wrinkling his nose as he stared at the brig.</p>

<p>&#8216;But why should they board us?&#8217; exclaimed
Mr. Johnson. &#8216;If they do, it will be
the captain&#8217;s fault. Why does he want to go on
sticking <i>here</i> for, as if, by George! we were a
man-of-war with three decks bristling with
guns and crammed to suffocation with men?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There is no wind,&#8217; said I; &#8216;and without
wind, Johnson, ships cannot sail.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then why the confounded dickens don&#8217;t
he lower all the boats,&#8217; he cried, &#8216;and fill them
with sailors, and tug the ship out of sight of
that beast there?&#8217;</p>

<p>I laughed outright.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, I&#8217;m not in the habit of using strong
language,&#8217; said Mr. Emmett, scowling at the
brig; &#8216;but curse me if I&#8217;m going to fight.
My simple contention is, I&#8217;ve paid my money
to be transported peacefully to India; and,&#8217;
added he, with a glance aft at old Keeling, who
was staring up at the sky, as though to observe
if there were any drift in the vapour up there,
&#8216;if he don&#8217;t fulfil his undertaking, I&#8217;ll sue him
or his owners for breach of contract.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>&#8216;I&#8217;m no sailor,&#8217; exclaimed Mr. Johnson,
&#8216;but I may claim to have some intelligence as
a landsman, and my argument is,&#8217; he cried,
talking in a loud voice, &#8216;that it is quite in
Captain Keeling&#8217;s power to launch the boats
and drag the ship away from this spot. In an
hour the brig would be out of sight.&#8217;</p>

<p>At that instant there was a flash of lightning
that made a crimson dazzle of the dark
heavens beyond the brig, where the sky
sloped in a horrible yellowish slate colour
into the sooty thickness which circled the
horizon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ha!&#8217; cried Mr. Emmett, &#8216;I don&#8217;t like
lightning;&#8217; and he abruptly trundled down
the poop ladder to the quarter-deck and disappeared.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s a mess to be in!&#8217; grumbled Johnson.
&#8216;It&#8217;s all very well to shoot or be shot at
if you make butchery a profession. But to be
maimed or killed in some cheap affray&mdash;having
to fight for people you don&#8217;t care a
hang about&mdash;obliged, for instance, to jeopardise
your eyes, your limbs, perhaps your very
existence, for an old woman like Mrs.
Bannister, when the business is not in one&#8217;s
line at all&mdash;&#8217; He clenched his fist, and fetching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
his thigh a whack with it, exclaimed: &#8216;Let
little hectoring Colonel Cock-a-doodle-doo cut
as many throats as he can come at&mdash;I am a
man of peace. I have parted with a large
sum to get to India in comfort; and to expect
me to help the sailors to fight is as monstrous
as to look to me to assist them in furling the
sails and scrubbing the decks.&#8217;</p>

<p>Thus speaking, he followed Mr. Emmett
down on to the quarter-deck.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>A STORM OF WIND</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> atmosphere now took a deeper tinge of
gloom. Thunder had followed the blaze of
lightning in the west, low, distant, but continuous,
like a rapid succession of the batteries
of several ships of war heard from afar; and
as the echoes of this ominous growling swept
to our ears over the glass-smooth heave of the
swell, the fresh dye of gloom came into the
day and made an evening darkness of the
afternoon.</p>

<p>The noise of the thunder had been like
calling a hush upon the ship. The men hung
in silent groups along the decks; motionless
at the wheel was the tall form of a powerful
sailor gripping the spokes with an iron clutch
that was scarcely to be shaken by the frequent
hard drag of the tiller-gear to the kick
of the rudder; the seamen stationed at the
guns aft stood with folded arms or hands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
carelessly thrust into their pockets gazing at
the brig, or, with the impatient looks of
sailors kept idly waiting on deck during their
watch below, directing glances at the horizon
or the sky, as though in search of some sign
of wind. The three mates continued to overhang
the rail near the captain, who walked
the length of a plank to and fro with a telescope
under his arm, which he would sometimes
level at the brig, afterwards addressing
his officers in a low voice.</p>

<p>All the ladies were below; but shortly after
Mr. Johnson had left me, Miss Temple came
on deck and went to the side to look at the
stranger, and there lingered, with her gaze
upon the western sky, over which the lightning
was now running in fluid lines, a cascading
of fiery streaks with a frequent dull
opening blaze low down, which the heads of
the swell would catch and mirror as though
it were an instant gleam of sunset. Had she
condescended to glance my way, I should have
joined her. She loitered a while, and then
left the deck; and at the same moment the
second-mate came forward to the break of the
poop and called out an order for the foresail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
and mizzen topsail to be furled and the foretopsail
to be close reefed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Very unpleasant state of suspense this,&#8217;
said little Mr. Saunders, stealing to my side
and looking up into my face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Very,&#8217; I answered; &#8216;but it seems as if
the weather was to extinguish our anxiety as
regards the brig.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said he. &#8216;I heard the captain tell
Mr. Prance that he believes there is a gale of
wind behind that storm yonder. Gracious
me! what a very vivid flash. Hark! it nears
us quickly.&#8217;</p>

<p>There was a rattling peal of thunder now,
a long volleying roar of it, and a few large
drops of rain fell. Mr. Cocker stood at the
rail with a telescope in his hand. He busily
watched the men up aloft, sometimes letting
fly an order to the boatswain in a voice that
went past the ear like a stone from a sling.
A large drop of rain splashed upon Mr.
Saunders&#8217;s nose.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s about to burst, I think,&#8217; said he, looking
straight up into the heavens with his
modest yearning eyes. &#8216;I shall go below;&#8217;
and down trotted the little creature.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Cocker,&#8217; said I, &#8216;lend me your glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
for an instant, will you?&#8217; I pointed it at the
brig. &#8216;Yes,&#8217; I exclaimed, talking to the
second-mate with the telescope at my eye; &#8216;I
believe I was not mistaken. Full of men,
indeed! Phew! Why, there are hands
enough upon her yards to furnish out the
complement of a fifty-gun frigate.&#8217;</p>

<p>It was indeed as I said. They were furling
all canvas upon the stranger, intending
apparently to let her meet what was to come
with a small storm foretrysail, which I could
see a crowd of seamen bending and making
ready for setting. Her fore and topsail
yards were loaded with men swarming like
bees along the thin delicate lines of spars, and
even as I watched, the canvas they were rolling
up melted away into slender streaks of white.
In the cross-trees of both masts, and higher
yet on the yards above, and in the tops also,
were a number of men busily employed in
sending down the royal, skysail, and topgallant
yards and housing the topgallant masts.
There looked to me to be at least a hundred
of a crew to the vessel.</p>

<p>You found something almost ghastly and
absolutely startling in the sharp distinctness
of the little fabric rolling against the thunder-black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
skies behind her, and upon the long,
malignant, greenish-hued swell in which the
plunging lightning was sparkling as though
the water were crackling with phosphoric
fires. Dark as the atmosphere was with the
deep shadow of storm, the brig stood out to
the eye visible to the minutest detail the
sight could reach to, plunging heavily under
her naked spars, with her wet black sides
darting out the mirrored flame of the lightning
flashes with as clear a dazzle as glass or
polished brass would throw.</p>

<p>&#8216;The number of her crew witnesses to her
character,&#8217; said I, returning the telescope to
Mr. Cocker.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, there is no doubt of her,&#8217; he exclaimed;
&#8216;the captain&#8217;s an old hand, and
twigged her speedily.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The weather will put an end to her, I expect,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;Very lucky for us, Mr. Cocker.
A large crew of ruffians and six guns of a
side, not to mention a twenty-four pounder in
the bows, and cutlasses and small arms in
galore, hardly form a joke. It is easy to
figure the beauty, that sails, I daresay, three
feet to our one, quietly sheering alongside and
throwing seventy or eighty of her children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
aboard, dark-skinned assassins, armed to the
teeth, reeking of garlic. Well, hang me,
Mr. Cocker, if I didn&#8217;t believe that the times
of those gentry had passed some years
ago.&#8217;</p>

<p>His lips were moving to answer me, but
there was a wide and blinding flash of lightning
at that instant that set the heavens on
fire, immediately followed by a crash of
thunder as deafening as though a first-rate
had blown up close aboard us. Yet again
the scowl of the clouds deepened in darkness,
and the brig grew vague on a sudden in the
gloom of the storm.</p>

<p>&#8216;There comes the rain!&#8217; cried Mr.
Cocker, pointing to a line of greyish shadow
with a look of steam boiling up as it were
from the base of it. It drew creeping slowly
on to the brig, and its perpendicular fall made
one think of it as of a vast sheet of water
up above overflowing and cataracting sheer
down over the edge of a cloud.</p>

<p>&#8216;There is no wind there,&#8217; said I; &#8216;it is a
regular Irishman&#8217;s hurricane, right up and
down. But here goes for a waterproof.&#8217;</p>

<p>I trundled below for a suit of rubber
clothes, being too anxious to observe what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
was to happen to choose to leave the deck.
All the passengers were congregated in the
cuddy, and the lightning, as it glittered in
the port-holes and skylights, flashed up their
faces in the gloomy atmosphere, making them
look a pale and trembling crowd. The
colonel was pacing the deck near the piano.
Miss Hudson leaned against her mother with
her hands over her eyes. If ever there came
a brighter flash than usual, one lady or
another would scream. Colledge and Miss
Temple sat over a draught-board; but I
could not gather, from the hurried glance I
threw over the people as I passed through
them, that they were playing. I equipped myself
from head to foot in waterproofs and came
again into the saloon on my way to the poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you going on deck, Dugdale?&#8217; cried
Mr. Johnson, shouting aloud, to render his
voice audible above the continuous cannonading
of the thunder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; I replied.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will be struck dead, sir,&#8217; called out
Mrs. Hudson.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have half a mind to join you,&#8217; said
Mr. Emmett, jumping up with a wild look at
the skylight: &#8216;it&#8217;s simply beastly down here.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>&#8216;Hark to that!&#8217; bawled the colonel;
&#8216;there&#8217;s a shower for you!&#8217;</p>

<p>The wall of rain had reached us. For a
minute before it struck the ship you could
hear it hissing upon the sea like twenty
locomotives blowing off steam; then plump!
came the cataract on to our decks. Had
every drop been a brick, the noise could not
have been more astounding. One couldn&#8217;t
hear the thunder for the roaring of the fall
of water and hailstones, though the deep and
awful note of the electric storm was in it to
add to its tremendous sound. The darkness
was now so heavy in the cuddy, that in the intervals
of the lightning the faces of the people
were scarce distinguishable. Amid the distracting
noises of the thunder, of the breathless
storm of hail and rain, of the water cascading
off the decks overboard in a furious gushing
and seething, arose the chorus of a number of
seamen on the quarter-deck hauling upon the
maintopsail halliards there, with the piercing
chirruping of the boatswain&#8217;s pipe and
hoarse orders delivered overhead from the
poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s the steward?&#8217; bawled the
colonel in his loudest tones. &#8216;Confound it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
are we to be left in total blackness here?
Why don&#8217;t some one light the lamps?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you coming on deck, Mr. Emmett?&#8217;
I cried; but he had sunk back on his seat
with his arms folded and his head bowed;
and obtaining no reply, I walked to the companion
steps, receiving, as I passed Miss
Temple, a half interrogative glance from her,
which made me look again in readiness to
answer the question that seemed to hover on
her lips. But her eyes instantly dropped, and
the next instant she had turned to say something
to her aunt, who was on a sofa behind
her; so, rounding on my heel, up I went into
the smoking wet.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be seen but rain&mdash;such
a sheet of it as one must explore the
latitudes we were in to parallel. The lightning
flashed amidst it incessantly, and every line of
the falling water sparkled like glowing wire
in dazzling hues of crimson and of violet
alternating. I waited under the shelter of
the companion cover till the first weight of
all this rain and hail should have passed.
Through the haze of moisture that rose like
steam off the decks to the cataractal swamping
I could discern the figure of old Keeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
looking like a soaked scarecrow, the fine-weather
hat upon his head reduced to pulp
and hanging about his ears like a rotten fig.
The fellow at the wheel stood like a statue
amid the drenching downpour; but the men
who had been stationed at the guns were
gone.</p>

<p>I had not been a minute in the hatchway
when the heavens seemed to be split open to
the very heart of their depths by a flash of
lightning, followed in the space of the beat of
a heart by a shock of thunder that seemed to
happen immediately over our mastheads&mdash;a
most soul-subduing crash, if ever there was
one! and as if by magic, the rain ceased, and
the atmosphere sensibly brightened. There
was a great noise of shrieking in the cuddy,
and half blinded, and pretty handsomely dazed
by that terrible blast of lightning and the thunder-clap
which had followed, I crept down the
steps with my pulse beating hard in my ears
to see what had happened, scarce knowing
but that some one had been struck and perhaps
killed.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it?&#8217; I shouted to the colonel,
who stood at the foot of the ladder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Only Mrs. Hudson in hysterics,&#8217; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
roared; on hearing which I went up again,
being in no temper to make one of the nervous
company below.</p>

<p>The swell had flattened; all to starboard
there was an oozing as of daylight into the
breathless thickness, with ugly hump-shaped
masses of black vapour defining themselves
up in the ugly sallow smother in a sort of writhing
way, as though they were coming together
in a jumble; but to port it was as black as
thunder, an inky slope hoary with rain, with
lightning spitting and zigzagging all over it.
I went to the rail, where stood Mr. Cocker
with his clothes full of water.</p>

<p>&#8216;A pretty little shower!&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Very,&#8217; he answered, with his face showing
of a bleached look like the flesh of a
washerwoman&#8217;s hand. &#8216;A plague on this
sort of work, say I! This serge shrinks consumedly
when drenched, and my trousers will
be up to my knees to-morrow morning&mdash;three
pounds ten as good as washed out of a man&#8217;s
pocket.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&#8217;s your glass, Mr. Cocker?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;In that hencoop there,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>I pulled out and directed it at the dim
blotch of brig that had caught my eye stealing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
out of the wet dusk like the phantom of
a ship.</p>

<p>&#8216;By my great-grandfather&#8217;s wig!&#8217; cried I
with a start. &#8216;So! no fear <i>now</i> of being
boarded. Our windpipes are safe for the
present. Look for yourself, Mr. Cocker.&#8217;</p>

<p>He ogled her an instant, then bawled to
the skipper, who was speaking to Mr. Prance.</p>

<p>&#8216;The brig&#8217;s been struck, sir! Her mainmast
is over the side.&#8217;</p>

<p>In very truth it was as he declared. I
whipped the glass out of his hand for another
look, and, sure enough, could clearly distinguish
a whole lumber of wreckage lifting to
the roll of the subdued swell alongside the
swaying hull of the brig. Her foremast and
topmast stood intact to the cross-trees, but
abaft she was as completely denuded as if a
chopper had been laid to the foot of the mast.
The mess is not to be described. I could
make out that a length of her bulwark was
crushed flat, and the black lines of shrouds
and gear went snaking overboard like so
many serpents wriggling out of the hatches
into the water. But the gloom was too deep
to suffer me to see what her people were
doing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>I went to the companion way and called
down to Colonel Bannister.</p>

<p>&#8216;Halloa? What now? Who wants <i>me</i>?&#8217;
he shouted.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tell the ladies, colonel,&#8217; I sung down,
&#8216;that the brig has been struck by lightning,
and that our safety, so far as <i>she</i> is concerned,
is assured.&#8217;</p>

<p>I heard him roar out the news as I went
to the side again, and a moment after up
rushed the whole body of passengers to see
for themselves. The decks were full of water,
but nobody seemed to mind that. The ladies
came splashing through it to the rail, some of
them taking terrified peeps at the mass of
winking blackness settling away down in the
east, and dodging the play of lightning, as it
were, with a sort of involuntary ducking of
their heads and lifting of their fingers to their
eyes.</p>

<p>Old Keeling cried out: &#8216;Ladies, be good
enough to take my advice and return to the
cabin. We shall be having a strong blow of
wind coming along in a few minutes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Gott, she iss on fire!&#8217; here shouted
Hemskirk, pointing directly at the brig with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
a fat forefinger, whilst with the other hand
he kept a binocular glass glued to his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it so then, sir!&#8217; cried Mr. Prance to
the skipper; &#8216;there is smoke rising from
her fore-hatch.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Cocker had replaced his telescope in
the hencoop; I jumped for it, and in a trice
had the lenses bearing upon the brig. There
was an appearance of smoke, a thin bluish
haze of it, as though mounting from a newly
kindled bonfire, slowly going spirally into the
motionless air; but almost at the instant of
my first looking I thought I could witness
something of a ruddy tinge flashing for a
breath into this smoke, as if to a sudden
leap of flame. Though the brig lay at the
same distance that had separated her from us
throughout the afternoon, the shrouded and
heaped-up vaporous wall of firmament beyond
her seemed to heave her as close again to us
as she really was; and now quite easily by
the aid of the glass I could see her decks as
she rolled them our way dark with her people,
many of them hacking and hewing at her
rigging, as though to clear away the wreckage;
others seemingly passing buckets along;
others, again, running wildly and as it might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
seem aimlessly about, whilst with the regularity
of a swing in action the beautifully
moulded hull rolled quietly from side to side
with a rhythmic oscillation of her one mast
upon which the fragment of white trysail
filled and hollowed as it beat the air, starting
out upon the eye with a very ghastliness of
pallor as it swelled to its cotton-like hue out
of the shadow of its incurving, and hovered
like some butterfly over the hideous dusky
green of the swell.</p>

<p>I replaced the telescope.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here comes the wind!&#8217; I heard Mr.
Cocker sing out.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ladies,&#8217; cried old Keeling, &#8216;let me beg of
you to step below.&#8217;</p>

<p>Most of them complied, but a few lingered,
staring with curiosity at the coming weather.
I watched it with amazement, for never before
had I seen a storm of wind coming down
upon a ship in a sort of wall. One saw the
line of it in a ridge of foam whose extremities
were lost in the gloom on either hand. It
was of a glass-like smoothness all in front of
it, and not a breath of air was to be felt when
the stormy hissing of it was loud in our ears
as it came sweeping up, the clouds on high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
darting to right and left, and a paler faintness,
as of increasing daylight, coming into the air
along with it. The bull-like notes of Mr.
Prance rang from the poop through the ship.</p>

<p>&#8216;Stand by maintopsail halliards&mdash;foretopsail
sheets&mdash;foretopmast staysail down-haul.&#8217;</p>

<p>The wind struck the brig. My eye was
upon her, and she disappeared in the shrieking
whirl of flying spume as you extinguish a
reflection in a mirror by breathing upon the
glass. A minute later it was upon us. It
smote the Indiaman right abeam, and down
she lay in a seething and hissing flatness of
boiling waters, stooping yet and yet, till the
line of the topgallant bulwark rail looked to
be flush with the furious yeasty smother.
There were two men at the helm holding the
wheel jammed hard over. I swung to a
belaying pin on the weather rail, and the poop
deck went down from me to leeward at an
angle that made one&#8217;s eyes reel in the head to
look along it. There was a true hurricane
note in the bellowing of the wind on high
under the rush and disparting of the maddened
clouds, and the first flash of it between
our masts was as the passage of a score of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
locomotives racing by at express speed and
shrieking as they went.</p>

<p>I was waiting to see what the ship meant
to do, when the weather maintopsail sheet
parted, though a treble-reefed sail, with a
sound like another clap of thunder, and in a
moment the canvas was flogging away from
the yard in ribands, with Mr. Cocker shouting
at the top of his voice, and a crowd of
seamen tumbling and capsizing about the
main deck to the officer&#8217;s orders to haul upon
the clewlines. It was at that instant, amidst
all this prodigious hallabaloo, that I caught
sight of Miss Temple to leeward of the mizzen
mast holding on to some gear that was belayed
at the foot of the mast. As my gaze rested
on her, the rope she grasped either overhauled
itself or was detached from the pin, and she
swung out to leeward. There were hencoops
and rails and the mizzen shrouds to save her
from going overboard; but there was nothing
to prevent her from breaking a limb, or even
her neck, if she let go. Though my legs yet
preserved something of their old seafaring
nimbleness, the slope of the deck made desperate
work for them. Yet the girl must be
reached, and at once. She did not appear to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
have sense enough to lower herself down the
rope till her feet touched, in which posture
she might have hung with safety. She maintained
her first clutch of the gear, and swung
above the deck to the height of some two,
perhaps three feet. Keeling, who was clinging
to the weather vang, did not seem to see her.
The helmsmen grinding at the wheel heeded
nothing but their business. Mr. Prance and
the second officer clawing at the brass rail at
the break of the poop, leaned to windward,
with their eyes on the streaming rags of the
maintopsail shouting commands.</p>

<p>There was only one means of arriving at
the girl with any approach to swiftness. I
dropped on to the deck, and went down upon
my knees with my head to windward, and
worked my way stern first in that attitude to
the line of lee hencoops, along which I made
shift to travel half jammed by my own weight
against the bars of the coops, until, coming
abreast of the girl, I got upon my legs, and
firmly planting my left foot against the bottom
of the row of boxes in which the fowls were
immured, and leaning on my right leg in a
fencing posture, I put my arms round her
waist and told her to let go. She did so at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
once, as likely as not because she could hold
on no longer. The weight of her noble figure
was rather more than I had bargained for. I
had thought to hold her fairly off the deck and
ease her away, whilst in my arms, down to the
hencoop behind, on which she could sit; but
she was too much for me. I was forced to
let her feet touch the planks, where, losing
her balance, she threw her arm round my
neck to save herself from falling. The next
moment I was lodged upon the hencoop, she
on my knee, and her arms still enclosing my
head; but this was only for a breath or two.
It was easy to lift her to my side, and there
she sat, her fine face dark with blushes, and
her eyes sparkling with alarm and confusion
and twenty other passions and emotions, whilst
the curve of her bosom rose and fell with
hysteric swiftness.</p>

<p>&#8216;What a very ridiculous position! It
serves me right. I should have taken the
captain&#8217;s advice. I should have gone below.&#8217;</p>

<p>This was all my haughty companion condescended
to say. Not a syllable of thanks&mdash;not
a glance of softness to reward me! However,
to be reasonable, she could have
scarcely been audible had she attempted more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
words. Even to catch the few sentences she
uttered I had to strain my ear to the movement
of her lips, off which the wind clipped her
speech with a silencing yell.</p>

<p>There had been but little in the thunder of
the storm, which still showed livid over the
eastern horizon, that surpassed the wild and
prodigious roaring of this first outfly of the
hurricane. The ship continued to lie down to
the fierce sweep of the wind at the angle she
had reached to&mdash;it was as good or bad, indeed,
as being on her beam ends&mdash;and Miss Temple
and I were forced to keep our seats upon the
hencoop, no more able to crawl up the deck
to where the companion hatch was than had
it been a slope of polished ice. This maybe
was what she meant by &#8216;the ridiculousness of
her position.&#8217; The captain, standing to windward,
was sending ominous looks at the band
of the foretopsail and at the foretopmaststay-sail,
the cloths of which continued miraculously
to hold. There was too much wind for the
sea to rise suddenly; indeed, the weight of
the blast had smoothed down what remains of
swell the rain and hail had left; the ocean
was a level surface of foam, out of which the
tempest of wind was tearing up whole snowstorms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
of flakes of spume, which flew over the
ship in clouds that whitened out into a sort
of dazzle, as though sun touched, as they flew
in their throbbing masses athwart the leaden
sky which poured across the sea over the ship&#8217;s
bows in rags and trailing lengths and gyrating
coils of sooty vapour.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look!&#8217; I shouted to Miss Temple, and
pointed over our stern, where, out of the
flying faintness and thickness of spray, the
figure of the brig was at that instant forming
itself.</p>

<p>I sprang upon the hencoop, the better to
see, grasping the mizzen shrouds for support.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall I give you a hoist?&#8217; I cried to the
girl.</p>

<p>Her curiosity was too strong; the flying
brig&mdash;a fleeting vision of the object which had
filled us with alarm and suspense throughout
the day, was a wonder to be witnessed at such
a time as that at any cost. Her lips parted
in the word yes to the howl of the gale, and
in a moment I had her up alongside of me,
my arm through hers, securely gripping and
supporting her, and the pair of us gazing
breathlessly at the sight astern.</p>

<p>With her single mast rising to the topmast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
cross-trees, the yards square, the remains of
the trysail streaming like white hair from gaff
and boltrope, the brig swept under our stern,
shooting sheer athwart, seething smoothly as
a sleigh over a level plain of snow, and rushing
before the wind straight as the flight of an
arrow. A coil of thick black smoke, whose
base was reddened by sudden tongues of fire,
blew over her bow, and coloured the atmosphere
into which she rushed with a complexion
of thunder. It seemed to rise from the fore-hatch,
and it fled straight off the deck. I
caught a sight of crowds of men forward and
aft, with a couple of fellows leaping into the
fore-rigging as the brig rushed by, to gesticulate
to us. But the vision came and went in
a few breaths like an object seen by lightning.
So dense was the gale with spray, that there
was scarcely a cable&#8217;s length of opening round
about us. The brig showed and was gone! a
phantasm, with the white waters pouring over
her spritsail yard as she rushed through it, and
no more of her was to be noted by the eye during
the headlong swiftness of her plunge from one
wall of spindrift into another, than the delicate
lines of her rigging supporting the foremast,
the bowsprit vanishing in a cloud of smoke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
blowing ahead of her, a length of white deck,
a flash of skylight glass, the glimmer, so to
speak, of some score of faces turned our
way.</p>

<p>&#8216;She is on fire,&#8217; I cried in Miss Temple&#8217;s
ear: &#8216;she carries a doomed crew into that
thickness!&#8217;</p>

<p>She moved, as if to resume her seat, and
very carefully I got her on to the hencoop
again.</p>

<p>But the first terrific spite of the gale was
now gone, and the squab form of the Indiaman
lifting a little out of the seething cauldron
in which she lay with her main-deck rail flush
with the yeasty surface, was beginning slowly
to pay off. Her decks gradually grew level,
and presently she was right before the wind,
with the howl of it at her taffrail, and her
huge bows heaping up the white sea till the
leaps of the summits were at either cathead.</p>

<p>Mr. Colledge&#8217;s face showed in the companion-way.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, there you are, Miss Temple!&#8217; he
roared. &#8216;Mrs. Radcliffe is firmly persuaded
you have been blown overboard.&#8217;</p>

<p>She rose, but sat again, for the wind was
too strong for her. Friend Colledge himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
seemed pinned by the weight of it in the
hatch.</p>

<p>&#8216;We may be able to manage it between us,&#8217;
I shouted; and passing my arm through hers,
I drove the pair of us to windward, and got
her on to the companion ladder, down which
she went.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>FIRE!</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> blew fiercely all that night. A mountainous
sea was rolling two hours after the first of
the gale, amid which the <i>Countess Ida</i> lay
hove-to under a small storm trysail, making
very heavy weather of it indeed. There was
a deal to talk about, but no opportunity for
conversing. Few were present at the dinner-table,
though the sea then running was
moderate in comparison with the sickening
heights to which it swelled later on; and there
was little more to be done throughout the
meal than to hold on for dear life, to keep a
keen weather-eye lifting upon one&#8217;s food, and
to gaze speechlessly across the table at one
another amid an uproar of howling hurricane,
of roaring waters, of straining bulkheads, of a
ceaseless clattering of crockery and other noisy
articles, that rendered conversation sheerly
impossible.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>And you may add to all this a good deal of
consternation amongst us passengers. I had
seen some weather in my time, but never the
like of such a tossing and plunging bout as
this. There were moments, indeed, when one
felt it high time to go to prayers: I mean when
the ship would lie down on the slant of some
prodigious surge until she was hanging by her
keel off the slope with her broadside upon the
water, as though it were the bottom of her.
There were many heave-overs of this sort,
every one of which was accompanied by half-stifled
shrieks from the cabins, by the sounds
of the crash of boxes, unlashed articles, chairs,
movable commodities of all kinds rushing with
lightning-speed to leeward. Heavy contributions
had been made upon our nervous
systems by the incidents of the day: the
vicinity of the brig&mdash;the prospect of having
our windpipes slit&mdash;the furious thunderstorm&mdash;the
spectacle of the lightning-struck
craft: and the stock of fortitude left amongst
us was but slender for a manly and courageous
encounter of such an experience as this night
was to prove.</p>

<p>I vividly recall the appearance of the
cuddy at eleven o&#8217;clock when the hurricane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
was nearing its height. The ship was hove-to
on the starboard tack, and the lamps in the
saloon would sometimes swing over to larboard
till their globes appeared to rest against the
upper deck. I had managed in some sort of
parrot fashion to claw along the table to
abreast of a swinging tray, where I mixed myself
a glass of cold brandy grog, with which
I slided down to a sofa on the lee-side; and
there I sat looking up at the people to
windward as at a row of figures in a gallery.</p>

<p>Heaven knows I was but little disposed to
mirth; yet for the life of me I could not refrain
from laughter at the miserable appearance
presented by most of my fellow-passengers
there assembled. Near to the cuddy front,
on the windward seats, sat Mr. Johnson, with
terror very visibly working in his white
countenance. His eyes rolled frightfully to
every unusually heavy stoop of the ship, and
his long lean frame writhed in a manner
ludicrous to see, in his efforts to keep himself
from darting forwards. Near him was Mr.
Emmett, who strove to hold himself propped
by thrusting at the cushions with his hands,
and forking out his legs like a pair of open
compasses with the toes stuck into the carpet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
on the deck, as though he was a ballet dancer
about to attempt a pirouette on those extremities.
Little Mr. Saunders, who had thoughtlessly
taken a seat on the weather side, sat
with his short shanks swinging high off the
deck in the last agonies, as one could see, of
holding on. My eye was on him when he
slided off the cushion to one of those dizzy
heaves of the ship which might have made
any man believe she was capsizing. He shot
off the smooth leather like a bolt discharged
from a cross-bow, and striking the deck,
rolled over and over in the manner of a boy
coming down a hill. There was nothing to
arrest him; he passed under the table and
arrived half-dead within a fathom of me; on
which I edged along to his little figure and
picked him up. He was not hurt, but was
terribly frightened.</p>

<p>&#8216;What shocking weather, to be sure!&#8217; was
all he said.</p>

<p>I put my glass of grog into the worthy
little creature&#8217;s hand, and he thanked me
with one of his long-faced, wistful looks,
then applied the tumbler to his mouth and
emptied it.</p>

<p>But to end all this: at three o&#8217;clock in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
morning there was a sensible decrease in the
gale. I had fallen asleep in the cuddy, and
waking at that hour, and finding but one
lamp dimly burning, and the interior deserted,
I worked my way to the hatch, groped along
to my cabin, and tumbled into my bunk,
where I slept soundly till half-past eight.
The sun was shining when I opened my eyes:
the ship was plunging and rolling, but easily,
and in a floating, launching manner, that
proved her to be sailing along with the wind
aft. Colledge was seated in his bunk with
his legs over the edge, gazing at me meditatively.</p>

<p>&#8216;Awake?&#8217; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Fine weather this morning, Dugdale.
But preserve us, what a night we&#8217;ve come
through, hey? D&#8217;ye remember talking of the
<i>fun</i> of a voyage? Yesterday was a humorous
time certainly.&#8217;</p>

<p>I sprang out of bed. &#8216;Patience, my friend,
patience!&#8217; said I; &#8216;this trip will end, like
everything else in our world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, at the bottom of the sea, for all one
is to know,&#8217; he grumbled. &#8216;A rod of land
before twenty thousand acres of shipboard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
say I. By the way, you and Miss Temple
looked very happy in each other&#8217;s company
when I peeped out of the hatch yesterday to see
what had become of her, at her aunt&#8217;s request.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You should have risen through the deck
a little earlier,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Yon would have
found her hanging.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hanging!&#8217; he cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, not by the neck,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;What did you do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I rescued her. I seized her by the waist
and bore her gloriously to a hencoop.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you put your arms round her waist?&#8217;
said he, staring at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;I did,&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>He looked a little gloomy. Then brightening
in a fitful kind of way, he said: &#8216;Well, I
suppose you <i>had</i> to do it&mdash;a case of pure
necessity, Dugdale?&#8217;</p>

<p>I closed one eye and smiled at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;She&#8217;s a very fine woman,&#8217; said he, gazing
at me gloomily again. &#8216;I trust you have not
been indiscreet enough to tell her that I am
engaged to be married?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh now, my dear Colledge, <i>don&#8217;t</i> let us
trifle&mdash;<i>don&#8217;t</i> let us trifle!&#8217; said I. &#8216;Scarcely
have you escaped the risk of being boarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
by pirates&mdash;the chance of being beheaded by
some giant picaroon&mdash;of being struck dead by
lightning&mdash;of foundering in this ship in the
small-hours, when round with circus speed
sweep your thoughts to the ladies again, and
your mouth is filled with impassioned questions.
Where&#8217;s your gratitude for these hairbreadth
escapes?&#8217; and being by this time in trim for
my morning bath, I bolted out of the cabin,
laughing loudly, and deaf to his shout of, &#8216;I
say, though, <i>did</i> you tell her that I was engaged?&#8217;</p>

<p>The ocean was a very grand sight. The
wind still blew fresh, but as the ship was running
with it, it seemed to come without much
weight. The sea was flowing in long tall
surges of an amazing richness and brilliance of
blue, and far and near their foaming heads
flashed out to the sunshine in a splendour of
whiteness that contrasted most gloriously with
the long dark slopes of unbroken water. From
sea-line to sea-line the sky was overspread with
clouds of majestic bulk and grandeur of
swelling form, as white in parts as the foam
which broke under them, and with many rainbows
in their skirts, and a tender violet shading
in the centre of them, that gave them as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
they soared above the horizon the look of
brushing the very heads of the coursing seas.
The Indiaman was thundering through it under
whole topsails and topgallant-sails, rolling with
the stateliness of a line-of-battle ship as she
went, with a rhythmically recurring stoop of
her ponderous bows till the water boiled to
the line of her forecastle rail, and her deck
forward looked to lie as flat as a spoon in the
dazzling smother.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. Prance on the poop, and having
had my bath, stepped aft to exchange a greeting
with him.</p>

<p>&#8216;The ship appears to have come safely out
of last night&#8217;s mess,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;It was a real breeze,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;nothing
suffered but the maintopsail. The <i>Countess
Ida&#8217;s</i> a proper ship, Mr. Dugdale. Those who
put her together made all allowances, even for
her rats. There&#8217;s some craft I know would
have strained themselves into mere baskets in
last night&#8217;s popple. But there was not an inch
more of water this morning in the <i>Countess&#8217;s</i>
well than will drain into her in twenty-four
hours in a river.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And the brig, Mr. Prance? I believe I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
and Miss Temple were the two who saw the
last of her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No. Captain Keeling spied her as she
swept under our stern,&#8217; said he. &#8216;She was on
fire; and by this time, I reckon her beautiful
hull&mdash;and truly beautiful it was, Mr. Dugdale&mdash;will
be represented somewhere around us
here by a few charred fragments.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Or,&#8217; said I, &#8216;even supposing they managed
to extinguish the fire, Mr. Prance, her one
mast with most of its heavy hamper aloft was
not going to stand the hurricane very long. So
she&#8217;ll either be a few blackened staves, as you
say, or a sheer hulk. And her people?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ah,&#8217; exclaimed the chief mate, fetching a
deep breath, &#8216;from eighty to a hundred of
them I allow. There&#8217;s no boat put together
by mortal hands could have lived last night.
By heavens though, but it is enough to make
a harlequin thoughtful to figure such a ship-load
of souls as that brig carried hurried into
mere carcases for the deep-sea dab to smell to
and the wall-eyed cod of the Atlantic to nibble
at.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, honestly, Mr. Prance&mdash;do you really
believe there was anything of the pirate about
that brig?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>&#8216;Honestly, Mr. Dugdale, I do, sir; and I
haven&#8217;t a shadow of a doubt that if the weather
had taken any other turn, if a sailing breeze
had sprung up, or the water had held smooth
enough for a boating excursion, her people
would have put us to our trumps with a good
chance of their crippling us and plundering
us, to say no more.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here the breakfast bell rang, and I rushed
to the cabin to complete my toilet for the
table.</p>

<p>There was no lack of talk this morning
when the passengers had taken their places.
The anxieties of the preceding day and night
seemed only to have deepened the purple hue
of old Keeling&#8217;s countenance, and his face
showed like the north-west moon in a mist
betwixt the tall points of his shirt collars, as
he turned his skewered form from side to side
answering questions, smirking to congratulations,
and bowing to the &#8216;Good-morning,
captain,&#8217; showered upon him by the ladies. Mr.
Johnson came to the table with a black eye, and
Dr. Hemmeridge&#8217;s forehead was neatly inlaid
with an immense strip of his own sticking-plaster,
the effect in both cases of the gentlemen
having fallen out of their bunks in the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
Colonel Bannister had sprained a wrist, and
the pain made him unusually vindictive and
aggressive in his remarks. The weather had
not apparently served the ladies very kindly.
Mrs. Hudson presented herself with her wig
slightly awry, and her daughter looked as if
she had not been to bed for a week. It was
hard to realise, in fact, that the pale spiritless
young lady with heavy violet eyes looking
languidly through their long lashes, which
deepened yet the dark shadow in the hollows
under them, was the golden, flashful, laughing,
coquettish young creature of the preceding
morning.</p>

<p>I had made sure of a bow at least from
Miss Temple; but I never once caught so much
as a glance from her. Yet she was very easy
and smiling in her occasional conversation
with Colledge across the table. She alone of
the women seemed to have suffered nothing
from the violent usage of the night that was
gone. In faultlessness of appearance, so far as
her hair and attire and the like went, she
might have stepped from her bedroom ashore
after a couple of hours spent with her maid
before a looking-glass. Not even a look for
me, thought I! not even one of those cold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
swiftly fading smiles with which she would
receive the greeting of a neighbour or a sentence
from the captain!</p>

<p>I was stupid enough to feel piqued&mdash;to
suffer from a fit of bad temper, in short, which
came very near to landing me in an ugly quarrel
with Mr. Johnson.</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye know, I rather wish <i>now</i>,&#8217; said this
journalist, addressing us generally at one end
of the table, but with an air of caution, as
though he did not desire the colonel to hear
him, &#8216;that that brig yesterday <i>had</i> attacked
us. It would have furnished me with an
opportunity for a very remarkable sea-description.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Tut!&#8217; said I, with a sneer; &#8216;before a man
can describe he must see; and what would
<i>you</i> have seen?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Seen, sir?&#8217; he cried; &#8216;why, everything
that might have happened, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Amongst the rats perhaps down in the
hold. Nothing more to be seen <i>there</i>, unless
it&#8217;s bilgewater.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Goot!&#8217; cried Mynheer Hemskirk. &#8216;It
vould hov been vonny to combare Meester
Shonson&#8217;s description mit der reeality.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I will ask you not to question my courage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>&#8217;
said Mr. Johnson, looking at me with a face
whose paleness was not a little accentuated by
his black eye. &#8216;I believe when it came to the
scratch I should be found as good as another.
<i>You</i> would have fought, of course,&#8217; he added,
with a sarcastic sneer at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes; I would have fought then, just as I
am ready to fight now,&#8217; said I, looking at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Gentlemen, gentlemen,&#8217; exclaimed Mr.
Prance, in a subdued reprimanding voice, &#8216;the
ladies will be hearing you in a minute.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You have been a sailor, Dugdale, you
know,&#8217; remarked Mr. Emmett in a satirical tone,
&#8216;and might, therefore, have guessed yesterday
that either the brig was a harmless trader, or
that, supposing her to have been of a piratical
nature, she would not attack us.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And what then?&#8217; cried I, eyeing him
hotly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he, with a foolish grin, &#8216;of
course, under those circumstances, a large
character for heroism might be earned very
cheaply indeed.&#8217;</p>

<p>Johnson lay back in his chair to deliver
himself of a noisy laugh. His seat was a fixed
revolving contrivance, and its one socketed
leg might have been injured during the night.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Be this as it may, on the journalist flinging
himself back with a loud applauding &#8216;Ha! ha!&#8217;
of his friend Emmett&#8217;s satiric hit at me,
the chair broke, and backward he went with
it with a knife in one hand and a fork in the
other. Old Keeling started to his feet; the
stewards came in a rush to the prostrate man.
Those ladies who were near gathered their
gowns about them as they watched him plunging
in his efforts to extricate himself from the
chair, in which his hips were in some manner
jammed. For my part, having breakfasted,
and being half suffocated with laughter, I
was glad enough to run away out on deck.
Indeed, the disaster had cooled my temper, and
this occurrence was something to be thankful
for, since one thing was leading to another,
and, for all one could tell, the journalist and I
might have come to blows as we sat side by
side.</p>

<p>He and Emmett cut me for the rest of the
day. My own temper was sulky for the most
part. I spent the whole of the morning on
the forecastle, smoking pipe after pipe in the
&#8216;eyes&#8217; of the ship, yarning in a fragmentary
way with the boatswain, who invented excuses
to come into the &#8216;head&#8217; to indulge in a brief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
chat with me, whilst by his postures and
motions he contrived to wear an air of business
to the gaze that might be watching from the
poop.</p>

<p>I would not own to myself that the sullen
cast of my temper that day was due to Miss
Temple; but secretly I was quite conscious
that my mood was owing to her, and the mere
perception of this was a new vexation to me.
For what was this young lady to me? What
could signify her coolness, her insolence, her
cold and cutting disregard of me? We had
barely exchanged a dozen words since we left
the Thames. Though my admiration of her
fine figure, her haughty face, her dark, tragic,
passionate eyes was extravagantly great, it was
hidden; she had not divined it; and she was
therefore without the influence over my moods
and emotions which she might have possessed
had I known that she was conscious how
deeply she fascinated me. She would not
even give me a chance to thoroughly dislike
her. The heart cannot steer a middle course
with such a woman as she. Had her
behaviour enabled me to hate her, I should
have felt easy; but her conduct was of the
marble-like quality of her features, hard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
polished, and too slippery for the passions to
set a footing upon. &#8216;Pshaw!&#8217; thought I again
and again, as I viciously hammered the ashes
out of the bowl of my pipe on the forecastle
rail, &#8216;am not I an idiot to be thinking of
yonder woman in this fashion, musing upon
her, speculating about her&mdash;a person who is
absolutely as much a stranger to me as any
fine lady driving past me in a London Park!&#8217;
Yet would I repeatedly catch myself stealing
peeps at her from under the arch of the
courses, hidden as I was right forward in the
ship&#8217;s bows, while she was pacing the length
of the poop with Mr. Colledge, or standing
awhile to hold a conversation with her aunt
and Captain Keeling, the nobility of her figure
and the chilling lofty dignity of her bearing distinctly
visible to me all that way off, and
strongly defining her amongst the rest of the
people who wavered and straggled about the
deck.</p>

<p>The wind lightened towards noon; the
fine sailing breeze failed us, and sank into a
small air off the larboard beam; the swell of
the sea went down, but the colour of the
brine was still the same rich sparkling blue of
the early morning. I had never seen so deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
pure and beautiful a tint in the ocean in these
parallels. It made one think of the Cape Horn
latitudes, with the white sun wheeling low,
and a gleam of ice in the distant sapphire
south. The great masses of cream-soft rainbow-tinctured
cloud melted out, and at two
o&#8217;clock in the afternoon it was a true
equinoctial day, and the Indiaman a hot
tropic picture, awnings spread, the pitch
softening betwixt the seams, a sort of bluish
steamy haze lazily floating off the line of her
bulwark rail, through which the dim sea-limit
showed in a sultry sinuous horizon. The ship
rippled through it, clothed to her trucks with
cloths that shone with the silver whiteness of
stars to the hot noontide effulgence. The
ayahs lolled about the quarter-deck, and
John Chinaman sat upon a carronade fretting
the baby he held into squeals of laughter and
temper by tossing to. The old sow grunted
with a grave grubbing noise under the long-boat,
and fore and aft every cock in the ship
was swelling his throat with defiant fine-weather
crowings.</p>

<p>It was somewhere about three bells that
evening&mdash;half-past seven o&#8217;clock&mdash;that I was
standing with Mr. Prance at the brass rail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
that protected the break of the poop, the
pair of us leaning upon it, watching a grinning
hairy fellow capering in a hornpipe a
little abaft the stowed anchor on the forecastle.
The one-eyed ape which we had rescued, and
which by this time was grown a favourite
amongst the seamen, sat low in the foreshrouds,
watching the dancing sailor&mdash;an odd bit of
colour for the picture of the fore-part of the
ship, clothed as he was in a red jacket and a
cap like an inverted flower-pot, the tassel of
it drooping to his empty socket. It was a
most perfect ocean evening, the west glowing
gloriously with a scarlet sunset, the sea tenderly
heaving, a soft warm breathing of air holding
the lighter sails aloft quiet. All the passengers
were on deck saving Miss Temple, who was
playing the piano to herself in the cuddy.
In the recess just under me were three or
four smokers; and the voice of Mr. Hodder
waxing warm in some argument with
Mynheer Peter Hemskirk, entered with unpleasant
disturbing emphasis into the tender
concert of sounds produced by the fiddlers
forward, the occasional laughter of the seamen,
the tinkling in the saloon, the voices of
the ladies aft, the gentle rippling of water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
alongside, combining, and softened by distance
and the vastness amid which the ship floated,
into a sort of music.</p>

<p>I was in the midst of a pleasant yarn
with Mr. Prance, whilst we hung over the
rail, half watching the jigging chap forward,
and half listening to each other. He was recounting
some of his early experiences at sea,
with a hint in his manner of lapsing anon into
a sentimental mood on his lighting upon the
name of a girl whom he had been betrothed
to.</p>

<p>All on a sudden the music forward ceased.
The fiddler that was working away upon the
booms jumped up and peered downwards in
the posture of a man snuffling up some strange
smell. The fellow who was dancing came to
a halt and looked too, walking to the forecastle
edge and inclining his ear towards the
fore-hatch, as it seemed. He stared round to
the crowd of his shipmates who had been
watching him, and said something, and a
body of them came to where he was and stood
gazing. The weather clew of the mainsail
being lifted, all that happened forward lay
plain in sight to those who were aft.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is wrong there?&#8217; exclaimed Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
Prance abruptly, breaking off from what he
was saying, and sending one of his falcon
looks at the forecastle. &#8216;The pose of that
fiddling chap might make one believe he was
tasting cholera somewhere about.&#8217;</p>

<p>A boatswain&#8217;s mate came down the forecastle
ladder and went to the fore-hatch, where
he paused. Then, with a glance aft, he came
right along to the quarter-deck with hurried
steps, and mounted the poop ladder, coming
to a stand when his head was on a level with
the upper deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it?&#8217; cried Mr. Prance.</p>

<p>The fellow answered in a low voice,
audible only to the chief officer and myself:
&#8216;There&#8217;s a smell of fire forwards, sir, and a
sound as of some one knocking inside of the
hatch.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A smell of fire!&#8217; ejaculated the mate;
and swiftly, though preserving his quiet bearing,
he descended to the quarter-deck and
walked forward.</p>

<p>I had long ago made myself free of all
parts of the ship, and guessed, therefore, that,
my following in the wake of the mate would
attract no attention, nor give significance to
a business which might prove a false alarm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
By the time he had reached the hatch, I was
at his side. The boatswain and sailmaker
came out of their cabins, a number of seamen
quitted the forecastle to join us, and the rest
gathered at the edge of the raised deck, looking
down. The fore-hatch was a great square
protected by a cover that was to be lifted in
pieces. A tarpaulin was stretched over it
with battening irons to keep it fixed, for this
was a hatch there was seldom or never any
occasion to enter at sea, the cargo in all probability
coming flush to it.</p>

<p>I had scarcely stood a moment in the
atmosphere of this hatch, when I became sensible
of a faint smell as of burning, yet too
subtle to be detected by a nostril that was not
particularly keen. As I was sniffing to make
sure, there came a hollow, dull noise of knocking,
distinct, and unmistakably produced by
some one immediately under the hatch striking
at it with a heavy instrument. Mr. Prance
hung in the wind for a second or two snuffling
and hearkening with the countenance of one
who discredits his senses.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;there <i>is</i> somebody
below, and&mdash;and&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; Here he sniffed up
hard with much too much energy, methought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
to enable him to taste the faint fumes. &#8216;Carpenter,&#8217;
he exclaimed to the withered old
Scotchman who made one of the crowd of
onlookers, &#8216;get this hatch stripped and the
cover lifted&mdash;quickly, but <i>quietly</i>, if you
please.&#8217;</p>

<p>He looked sternly round upon the men;
and then sent a hurried glance aft, where
stood Captain Keeling in the spot we had just
vacated, with Mrs. Radcliffe on his arm.</p>

<p>The battens were nimbly drawn, the tarpaulin
thrown aside, and some seamen stooped
to raise the hatch cover. A few seconds were
expended in prising and man&#339;uvring, in the
midst of which the knocking was repeated
with a note of violence in it, accompanied by
a general start and a growl of wonder from
all hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;Heave!&#8217; cried the carpenter, and up came
the cover, followed by a small cloud of blue
smoke, and immediately after by the figure of
the hideous sailor Crabb, who sprang from off
the top of a layer of white-wood cases with a
loud curse and a horrible fit of coughing.</p>

<hr class="chap" />




<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>CRABB</small></h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> atmosphere was still red with the
sunset, though the luminary was below the
horizon, and there was plenty of light to see
by. An extraordinary shout went up from
amongst the men at the sight of Crabb, as he
leapt out of the hatch in the heart of the
little cloud of smoke. Those who were on
the side of the deck on to which he jumped
recoiled with a positive roar of horror and
fright, one or two of them capsizing and rolling
over and over away from the hatch, as
though they were in too great a hurry to
escape to find time to get upon their legs.</p>

<p>I very well remember feeling the blood
desert my cheek, whilst my heart seemed to
come to a stand, and my breathing grow
difficult at the apparition of the fellow. <i>Crabb!</i>
Why, I had <i>seen</i> him lying dead in his bunk!
I had heard of him as lying stitched up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
hammock on this very fore-hatch! I had
beheld that same hammock flash overboard,
and I had watched it lifting and frisking away
astern! Who, then, was yonder hideous
creature that had jumped in hobgoblin fashion
out of the hold? Could he be the buried
Crabb himself?</p>

<p>There is no lack of things to frighten
people withal in this world; but I cannot
conceive of any shock comparable to the
instant consternation felt by a man who meets
another of whose death he is profoundly
assured, and whom he has been thinking of
as a corpse, dead and buried, for any number
of days gone by. The general horror, the
prodigious universal amazement which held
the mate and me and others amongst us
speechless and motionless, as though we had
been blasted and withered up by some electric
bolt from heaven, scarcely endured a minute;
yet by that handful of seconds was the picture
of this amazing incident framed. I see
Crabb now as he let fall his arm from his face
when his fit of choking coughing ceased: and
I recall the blind wild look of his distorted
eyes, as he slowly turned his countenance
round, as though the mild evening light was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
violently oppressive to his vision after the
days of blackness passed in the hold. His
repulsive countenance was dark with dirt and
grime. I observed many scratches upon his
arms, which were naked to the elbows, as
though he were fresh from squeezing and
boring through some ugly jagged intricacies
of stowed commodities. His shirt hung
in rags upon him; there were many rents in
his loose trousers; and there was blood upon
his exposed chest, from a wound seemingly
made by the sharp head of a nail or some edge
of iron-sheathed case.</p>

<p>&#8216;Seize that man, bo&#8217;sun,&#8217; suddenly roared
Mr. Prance, leaping out of his benumbed condition
of astonishment in a way to make one
think of a bull sweeping out through a hedge:
&#8216;handcuff him, and shut him up in your
berth for the present. Get the head-pump
rigged&mdash;the hose passed along. Jump for
buckets, and stand by to pass them down.&#8217;</p>

<p>The powerful hand of the boatswain closed
like a vice upon Crabb&#8217;s neck. I thought to
see a struggle, but the ugly sailor seemed weak
and dazed, and stepped passively to the boatswain&#8217;s
berth into which my friend shot him,
following and closing the door, to conceal, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
suppose, the operation of manacling the
man from the eyes of the half-stupefied
Jacks.</p>

<p>Half-stupefied, I say: but the orders of
the mate were like the flourish of some magic
wand over each man. There was a headlong
rush, though with something of discipline in
the hurry of it too, at the chief officer&#8217;s command.
Smoke was draining through the open
hatch, floating up thinly and lazily, though it
was a thing to make one hold one&#8217;s breath,
not knowing but that the next vomit might
prove a thicker, darker coil, with a lightning-like
reddening of the base of it to the flicker
of some deep down tongue of flame. Fire at
sea! Ah, great God! Out of the mere
thought of it will come the spirit of the
fleetest runner into the laziest and most lifeless
shanks.</p>

<p>The mate sprang on top of the cases stowed
level with the lower edges of the hold with a
cry for men to follow him. The interior was
the fore-part of the &#8217;tween decks, bulkheaded
off some little distance before the mainmast,
and filled with light, easily handled goods.
The hatch conducting to the ship&#8217;s hold lay
closed immediately under these few tons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
freight in a line with the yawning square into
which Mr. Prance had sprung. Where was
the fire? If in the lower hold, then heaven
help us! I glanced aft, and saw the captain
hastily walking forward. The passengers had
come together in a crowd, and were staring
with pale faces from the head of the poop
ladder. Old Keeling was perfectly cool. He
asked no questions, made no fuss, simply came
to the side of the hatch, saw Mr. Prance and
a gang of men at work breaking out the
cargo, and stood watching, never hindering
the people&#8217;s labour by a question. His keen
seawardly eye took in everything in a breath.
One needed but to watch his face to see <i>that</i>.
The placidity of the fine old fellow was a
magnificent influence. In an incredibly short
space of time, the captain meanwhile never
once opening his lips, the head-pump was
rigged, the hose trailed along and pointed
ready, a number of seamen were standing in
files with buckets ranged along all prepared for
drawing water, and passing it to the hatchway
with the swiftest expedition. I cannot express
the wonderful encouragement the heart found
in this silence alone. The captain trusted his
chief mate, saw that he exactly knew what to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
do, and stood by as a spectator, with just one
look of approval at his quiet, resolute, deep-breathing
ranks of seamen awaiting orders.</p>

<p>Once he turned his purple face, and observing
Mr. Johnson and Mr. Emmett and one
or two others nervously edging their way forwards,
he beckoned with a long forefinger to
a boatswain&#8217;s mate and said in a low voice:
&#8216;Drive those gentlemen aft on to the poop,
and see that none of the passengers leaves it.&#8217;
He glanced at me once, but said nothing, possibly
because he had found me looking on when
he arrived.</p>

<p>All as tranquilly as though the job was no
more than the mere breaking out of a few
boxes of passengers&#8217; luggage, the work of removing
the cargo so as to get at the fire proceeded.
The smoke continued to steal
stealthily up. The contents of the cases I do
not know, but they were light enough to be
lifted easily. A number of them were got on
deck. The mate and Mr. Cocker&mdash;who had
arrived from his cabin shortly after the captain
had come&mdash;headed the gang of workers, and
rapidly disappeared in the lanes they opened.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here it is!&#8217; at last came a muffled shout.</p>

<p>Mr. Cocker coming out of a dark hole like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
a rat, with the perspiration streaming from
him as though a bucket of oil had been capsized
over his head, sang out for the hose to
be overhauled and the pump to be worked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you discovered the fire, sir?&#8217; said
the captain, calling down to him in such a
collected voice as he would have used in
requesting a passenger to take wine with
him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir. It is a small affair. The hose
will suffice, I think, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>An instant after, the clanking of the plied
pump was to be heard along with the sound
of water steadily gushing, followed by a cloud
of steam, which quickly vanished. A quarter
of an hour later the mate came up black
as a chimney-sweep. He touched his cap to
the captain, and simply said: &#8216;the fire&#8217;s out,
sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What was it, Mr. Prance?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A bale of blankets, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Can you guess how it originated?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I expect that the man Crabb&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; began
the mate.</p>

<p>The captain started and stared.</p>

<p>&#8216;The man Crabb,&#8217; continued Mr. Prance,
&#8216;whom we imagined dead and buried, sir, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
been skulking in the hold&#8217;&mdash;old Keeling
frowned with amazement&mdash;&#8216;and I have no
doubt he fired the bale whilst lighting his
pipe.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Crabb in the hold!&#8217; cried the skipper;
&#8216;do you speak of the man whom we buried,
sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The same, sir,&#8217; answered Mr. Prance.</p>

<p>Old Keeling gazed about him with a gaping
face. &#8216;But he died, sir, and was buried,&#8217; he
exclaimed. &#8216;I read the funeral service over
him, and saw, sir&mdash;Mr. Prance, I <i>saw</i> with my
own eyes the hammock fall from the grating
after it had been tilted.&#8217;</p>

<p>The chief officer said something in reply
which I did not catch, owing to the noise
amongst the men who were yet in the hold
and the talk of the sailors round about. He
then walked to the boatswain&#8217;s berth followed
by the captain, that old marline-spike&#8217;s eyes
might bear witness to the assurance that the
Crabb who had leapt up out of the fore-hatch
in a smother of smoke was the same Crabb
who had been solemnly interred over the ship&#8217;s
side some weeks before.</p>

<p>Mr. Cocker came wriggling out of the
hold and got on to the deck alongside of me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
superintend the restowal of the broken-out
goods.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is the fire out?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Black out,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;It was no
fire, to speak truly of it, Mr. Dugdale. A top
bale of blankets or some such stuff was
smouldering in about the circle of a five-shilling
piece&mdash;a little ring eating slowly
inwards, but throwing out smoke enough to
furnish forth a volcano for a stage-scene. A
beastly smell! not to speak of some of the
stuff down there being as blackening as a
shoe-polisher&#8217;s brushes.&#8217; Here he looked at
the palms of his hands, which were only a
little more grimy than his face.&mdash;&#8216;But what&#8217;s
this I hear about Crabb? Has the dead
sailor come to life again?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s yonder,&#8217; said I, nodding towards
the boatswain&#8217;s berth, which the captain and
mate had entered, closing the door after them:
&#8216;you&#8217;ll need to see to believe. Time was that
when a man was dropped over a ship&#8217;s side
with a cannon-ball at his feet he was
as dead as if his brains were out. D&#8217;ye
remember, Mr. Cocker, how that hammock
went floating astern, as if there were less
than a dead sailor in it, though something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
more than nothing? There&#8217;s been some
devilish stealthy scheme here depend upon it.
We may yet find out that the ship wasn&#8217;t
scuttled because the ugly rogue hadn&#8217;t time to
pierce through the lower hatch before he
set the vessel on fire.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But he was a dead man, sir; Hemmeridge
saw him dead,&#8217; cried Cocker, eyeing
me with an inimitable air of astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay,&#8217; said I, &#8216;dead as the bones of a
mummy. But he&#8217;s <i>there</i> all the same,&#8217; I added
pointing to the forecastle cabin, &#8216;as alive as
you or I, and capable, I daresay, of kicking
after a little.&#8217;</p>

<p>At this moment the mate put his head out
of the boatswain&#8217;s berth and called to Mr.
Cocker, on which I walked leisurely aft, with
amazement in me growing, and scarcely
capable of realising the truth of what I had
seen.</p>

<p>The passengers were still crowding the
fore-part of the poop, peering and eagerly
talking, but in subdued voices, with Colonel
Bannister moving angrily amongst them, and
the boatswain&#8217;s mate sentinelling the foot of
the ladder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; cried Mrs. Radcliffe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
leaning over the rail and crying down her
question with a pecking motion of her head;
&#8216;is the fire out, do you know? Are we
safe?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The fire <i>is</i> out, madam,&#8217; I replied, lifting
my hat; &#8216;and the ship is as safe this minute
as ever she was in the Thames. Captain
Keeling will, I have no doubt, be here very
shortly to reassure you.&#8217;</p>

<p>Miss Temple, towering half a head above
her aunt, looked down at me with an air of
imperious questioning in her face. There
was a hot scarlet blush all along the west, yet
with power enough in its illumination to
render each face of the crowd above quite
distinguishable against the tender shadow
stealing from the east into the air, and I
could see an eagerness in the girl&#8217;s full, dark,
glowing, and steadfast gaze to warrant me
the honour of a conversation with her if I
chose to ascend the ladder. But just then
Hemmeridge came out of the cuddy on to
the quarter-deck with the hint of a stagger
in his walk. His eyes showed that he was
only just awake, and his hair that he had run
out of his cabin in a hurry.</p>

<p>&#8216;I say, Dugdale,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;what&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
been the matter, hey? Fire, is it? And the
steward tells me that Crabb has come back.
Has the man gone mad?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s been a fire,&#8217; said I, &#8216;and Crabb
has come back.&#8217;</p>

<p>Here Cocker came along the deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;Doctor, the captain wants you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where is he?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come along; I&#8217;ll take you to him,&#8217; said
the second mate, running his eye over
Hemmeridge&#8217;s figure with a half-look on at me
full of meaning in it.</p>

<p>They walked forward, the doctor a trifle
unsteady in his gait, I thought.</p>

<p>I went to my berth for some tobacco; I
stayed a short time below, and when I returned,
the last scar of sunset was gone. The
west was a liquid violet darkness trembling
with stars, and the ship was floating through
the darkness of the night, which in these
latitudes follows swiftly upon the heels of the
departing day. Captain Keeling had come
aft, and was standing in the midst of a crowd
of passengers answering questions, and soothing
the women, who were snapping inquiries
in whole volleys, their voices threaded by
tremors and shrill with nerves. Mr. Prance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
who had found time to cleanse himself, was on
deck in charge of the ship. All was hushed
forwards. Against the stars twinkling over
the line of the forecastle rail under the foot
of the foresail, that slowly lifted and fell to
the heave of the ship. I could distinguish the
outlines of sailors moving here and there in
twos and threes. A subdued hoarse prowling of
voices came out of the block of darkness round
about the galley and the long-boat, where
were gathered a number of men, doubtlessly
discoursing on the marvellous incident of the
evening. The glittering brilliants in the sky
winked like dewdrops along the black edge of
the spars and at the extremity of the yard-arms;
and spite of the voices of the people
aft and of the mutterings forward, so deep was
the ocean hush up aloft that again and again
the sound of the delicate night-breeze, breathing
lightly into the visionary spaces of the
sails, would fall like a sigh upon the ear.</p>

<p>&#8216;An exciting piece of work, Mr. Prance,&#8217;
said I, stepping to his side, &#8216;taking it from
the start to the close.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, yes,&#8217; he answered. &#8216;The passengers
will not be wanting in experiences to relate
when they get ashore. Enough has happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
yesterday and to-day, in the way of excitement,
I mean, to last out an ordinary voyage,
though it were as long as one of Captain
Cook&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What has Hemmeridge to say about this
business of Crabb, do you know?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;You will keep the news to yourself, if you
please,&#8217; he answered; &#8216;but I don&#8217;t mind telling
<i>you</i> that he&#8217;s under arrest&mdash;that is to say,
he has to consider himself so.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What for?&#8217; I asked, greatly astonished.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why, Mr. Dugdale,&#8217; said he, slowly looking
round, to make sure that the coast was
clear, &#8216;you may easily guess that this business
of the scoundrel Crabb&mdash;an old pirate, as I
remember telling you, signifies a very deep-laid
plot, an atrociously ingenious conspiracy.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I supposed that at once,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;The fellow Crabb feigned to be dead,&#8217; he
continued. &#8216;A sham it must have been, otherwise
he wouldn&#8217;t be in irons yonder. Now,
are we to believe that Hemmeridge can&#8217;t
distinguish between death and life? He
reports the man dead to the captain. The
fellow is stitched up; but, as we have since
ascertained, a prepared hammock is substituted
for the one that conceals his remains, and we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
bury maybe some clump of wood. This is
the part Captain Keeling least likes, I think.
He is a pious old gentleman, and his horror
when&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; He checked himself with a cough,
and a sound on top of it like a smothered
laugh, as though he enjoyed some fancy in
his mind, but durst not be too candid, since it
was the captain he talked about.</p>

<p>&#8216;It is assumed,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that Hemmeridge
represented Crabb as dead knowing him to be
alive?&#8217; He nodded. &#8216;What will have been
the project?&#8217; I continued, shaping out the
truth as, bit by bit, it formed itself in my
head. &#8216;Robbery, of course. Ay, Mr. Prance,
that will have been it. Crabb is to be
smuggled into the hold, the notion throughout
the ship being that he is dead and overboard;
and when in the hold&#8217;&mdash;&mdash; I stopped.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well,&#8217; said he with a shrug of his
shoulders, &#8216;there&#8217;s the mail-room. What else?
With a parcel of diamonds in it worth seventy
thousand pounds, not to speak of money,
jewelry, and other precious matters.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;By heavens! did any man ever hear the
like of such a plot?&#8217; cried I; &#8216;and Hemmeridge
is suspected as a confederate?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We shall see, we shall see,&#8217; he answered.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>&#8216;Just tell me this, Mr. Prance,&#8217; I exclaimed,
thirsty with curiosity, &#8216;who are the others involved?
Somebody must have shifted Crabb&#8217;s
remains.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The sailmaker is in irons,&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes! I might have sworn it! Why is it
that the high Roman nose of that chap has
haunted my recollection of the ghastly
appearance Mr. Crabb presented at every recurrence
of my mind to the loathsome picture?&#8217;</p>

<p>He slightly started, and I could see him
eyeing me earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8216;By the way,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;now that I
think of it, Hemmeridge showed Crabb&#8217;s body
to <i>you</i>, didn&#8217;t he?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly he did,&#8217; I responded.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, it will give the doctor a chance,&#8217;
said he, as though thinking aloud; and so
saying he made some steps in the direction of
the captain, and I went down on the quarter-deck
to blow a cloud and muse upon the
matters he had filled my mind with.</p>
